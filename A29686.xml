         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To be in a gracious ſtate is true happineſs, but to know our ſelves to be in ſuch a ſtate, is the top of our happineſs in this world.

Will you give me leave to ſay,</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Some men of name in their day have laid down ſuch things for evidences or characters of grace, which being weighed in the ballance of the Sanctuary will be found too light. But here a mantle of love may be of more uſe than a lamp; and therefore,</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Many, yea very many there are, whoſe graces are very weak, and much buried under the earth and aſhes of many fears, doubts, ſcruples, ſtrong paſsions, prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corruptions, and diabolical ſuggeſtions, who would give as many worlds as there be men in the world (had they ſo many in their hands to give) to know that they have grace, and that their ſpiritual eſtate is good, and that they ſhall be happy for ever. Now, this <hi>Treatiſe</hi> is fitted up for the ſervice of theſe poor hearts; for the weakeſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians may turn to many clear and well-bottomed eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in this <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> and throw the <hi>Gantlet</hi> to <hi>Satan,</hi> and bid him prove if he can that ever any prophane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or cunning hypocrite under heaven had ſuch eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or ſuch fair certificates to ſhew for heaven, which he has to ſhew. The generality of Chriſtians are weak, they are rather <hi>Dwarfs</hi> than <hi>Gyants,</hi>

Certainly 'tis one thing to judge by our graces, and another thing to reſt on our graces, or to put our truſt in our graces, or to make a Saviour of our graces; there is a great deal of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween declaring and deſerving. Doubtleſs Chriſtians may look to their graces as evidences of their intereſt in Chriſt,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52491:22"/> juſtification and ſalvation, though not as cauſes of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt, juſtification and ſalvation. O Sirs, we muſt alwayes carefully diſtinguiſh 'twixt the root and ground of our comfort, and between the teſtimonies or evidences of our intereſt in the root of our comfort. Now it muſt be readily granted that Jeſus Chriſt is the only root and ground of a Chriſtians comfort and triumph; and therefore ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 6 14.</note> 
                     <hi>God forbid that I ſhould rejoyce in any thing, but in the Croſs of Chriſt.</hi> And ſo in that, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>New thanks be unto God, which alwayes cauſes us to triumph in Chriſt.</hi> So that, if at any time we behold this or that ſaving grace, or this or that part of holineſs ſhining in our hearts or lives, we take comfort in it, not as the cauſe, or root, or ground of our comfort or triumph, but as in a teſtimony or evidence, becauſe it doth manifeſt our intereſt in him, who is our comfort,<note place="margin">Luke 2 25. Col. 3 11. Gen. 9 13, 14, 16. v.</note> our peace, our joy, our ſalvation, our all in all. Look as the Rain-bow is not a cauſe, why God will not drown the world, but a ſign that God will not drown the world; and as it is a ſign that God will not drown the world, we may and ought to rejoyce in it, and to take comfort from it. So here, &amp;c. 'Tis agreed on all hands, that ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is a precious benefit of the Covenant of grace,<note place="margin">Jer. 33.8, 9. Ezek. 36.25, 26. Heb. 8.10, 12. &amp;c.</note> as well as juſtification; and what crime can it then be, to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence one benefit of the Covenant of grace, by another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the ſame Covenant. That he that is juſtified, is alſo ſanctified, and that he that is ſanctified is alſo juſtified, is ſo clear, ſo bright, ſo ſparkling, and ſo full a truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Covenant of grace, that no man or devil can deny. Now what evil or error can it be for a man to aſſert, That he that is certainly ſanctified, is certainly juſtified; (it being the very language of the Covenant of grace) and that therefore he that knows himſelf to be ſanctified, may alſo know thereby that he is juſtified. Certainly, thoſe perſons that ſhall deny ſanctification to be a moſt ſure, ſweet and comfortable evidence of a mans juſtification, they muſt not only blot out and aboliſh the Epiſtles of <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> but muſt alſo race out and aboliſh all thoſe Evangelical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of grace and mercy, of happineſs and bleſſedneſs,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52491:22"/> that are made to ſuch perſons as are inveſted, enriched and beſpangled with the ſeveral graces of the holy Spirit; this might be made evident by many hundred Scriptures: but take that one for all, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. where our Saviour himſelf (who was the moſt Evangelical Preacher that ever was in the world) makes eight or nine promiſes of mercy and bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to thoſe very perſons that had the graces of the Spirit inherent in them, as poverty of ſpirit, mourning, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, hungering and thirſting after righteouſneſs, &amp;c.

So when a Chriſtian can but find any one grace in him, as love to the Saints, for grace ſake, for godlineſs ſake, he may ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that there is in him all other graces; where there is but one link of this golden chain, there are all the links of this golden chain, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.35. <hi>By this ſhall all men know ye are my Diſciples, if ye love one another.</hi> He doth not ſay, if ye work miracles, if ye raiſe the dead, if ye give eyes to the blind, or ears to the deaf, or tongues to the dumb, or feet to the lame, but <hi>if ye love one another.</hi> There have been many, yea, very many precious Chriſtians, who have lived and died with a great deal of comfort and peace from the application of that Text to their own ſouls, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.14. <hi>We know that we have paſſed from death to life, becauſe we love the brethren.</hi> Sincere love to the brethren, is a moſt evident ſign of a Chriſtians being already paſſed or tranſlated from death to life; obſerve, the Apoſtle doth not ſay, we think we have paſſed from death to life, but we know we have paſſed from death to life; nor he does not ſay, we conjecture we have paſſed from death to life, but we know we have paſſed from death to life; nor he does not ſay, we hope we are paſſed from death to life, but we are aſſured that we are paſſed from death to life, that is, from a ſtate of nature into a ſtate of grace, becauſe we love the brethren; for ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this, when all other evidences have failed, many gracious Chriſtians, and all other Texts of Scripture have afforded them no comfort here, they have anchored here, they have found reſt for their diſtreſſed ſouls, and upon this one ſingle planck, this one evidence they have ſwam ſafely and comfortably unto the haven of eternal happineſs.

The whole Covenant (which is a bundle of promiſes) is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly thine, if any one promiſe be thine; the promiſes by a divine hand are mutually tyed and linked together; and thoſe whom God has joyned together, no man may put aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The promiſes can be no more divided, than Chriſt can be divided, or than heaven can be divided; the promiſes are not like loofe and unſtringed pearls, but as pearls made into one entire chain.

He that can lay his hand upon any one promiſe, that God has made to the waiting ſoul, and truly ſay this promiſe is mine, he may without all peradventure lay his hand upon every promiſe that God has made to the waiting ſoul, and ſay all theſe are mine; prove but your right in one, and you may ſafely infer your right to all.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52491:31"/> Scripture cannot be broken, or violated, or made void; but though this be an indiſpenſable duty, yet certainly there is (eſpecially in times of great afflictions, temptations, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions, fears and doubts) a very great aptneſs and prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Chriſtians to expect ſtrange means rather than right means, and new means rather than old means, and invented means rather than appointed means, &amp; to build their faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſomthing beſide the Word, or that is without the compaſs of the Word, rather than upon the plain and naked Word it ſelf; being in this very like to many weak, crazy, diſtempered and diſeaſed Patients, that are more ready to fancy every new Medicine and new Doctor they hear of, and to be tamper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, than to expect a recovery, by going through a courſe of Phyſick preſcribed by the Phyſician that beſt underſtands their diſeaſes, and the moſt proper and effectual means for their recoveries. You know when <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> came to the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> to be cured of his Leproſie, he only ſent out a Meſſenger to him, who bid him go and waſh ſeven times in <hi>Jordan,</hi> and his fleſh ſhould come again unto him, and he ſhould be clean, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.10. but <hi>Naamans</hi> bloud riſes, and his heart ſwells, and he grows very wrath, and all becauſe he did not like the means pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the Prophet, and becauſe he thought in his own heart, that the Prophet would have uſed more likely means to have wrought the cure, <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12. So many Chriſtians when they lye under great agonies and ſore perplexities of ſoul, and are encouraged to act faith upon the promiſes, and to reſt their weary ſouls upon the Word of grace, they are ready to think and ſay, that theſe things, theſe means will never heal them, nor comfort them, nor be a relief or ſupport unto them, unleſs the Lord does from heaven, by extraordinary Revelations, Viſions, Signs and Miracles, confirm his promiſes to them; and hereupon they make light of the bleſſed Scriptures, which are the ſprings of life, and the only bottom upon which all our comforts, peace and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is to be built; yea, they relinquiſh that more ſure word of prophecy which ſhines as a light in a dark place.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.19.</note> Certainly the acting of faith on the precious promiſes, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52491:32"/> the cleaving of the ſoul unto thoſe bleſſed truths declared in the Goſpel of grace, is the moſt ſure, ready and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious way of obtaining a bleſſed aſſurance,<note place="margin">Eph. 1.13.</note> and a full eſtabliſhment of heart,<note place="margin">Com. on <hi>Gen.</hi> cap. 38.</note> in all ſound, ſolid and abiding joy and peace; and therefore <hi>Luther,</hi> though (as he confeſſeth) he was often tempted to ask for Signs, Apparitions and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations from heaven to confirm him in his way, yet tells us how ſtrongly he did withſtand them, <hi>Pactum feci cum Domino Deo meo, &amp;c.</hi> I have (ſaith he) indented with the Lord my God, that he would never ſend me Dreams, Viſions, Angels, for I am well contented with this gift, that I have the holy Scripture, which doth abundantly teach and ſupply all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries for this life, and that alſo which is to come. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, <hi>Auſtin</hi> hit the mark, when he prayed, Lord, let thy holy Scriptures be my pure delights, in which I can neither deceive, or ever be deceived. Certainly the ballance of the ſanctuary ſhould weigh all the Oracles of God, decide all, and the Rule of Gods Word be the ſquare and judge of all. O Sirs, dare you venture your ſouls upon it, that the bleſſed Scriptures are falſe, that they are but a Fable? dare you ſtand forth, and ſay, if the Scriptures be not a lye, let us be damned for ever and ever? dare you ſtand up and ſay, we are freely contented that the everlaſting worm ſhall gnaw on our hearts for ever, and that our bodies and ſouls ſhall for ever and ever lye burning in infernal flames, if the Scriptures prove not at laſt a cheat, a deceit, a meer forgery and impoſture? Now, if you dare not thus to ſay, and thus to venture, then peremptorily reſolve to be determined by Scripture, in the great concernments of your precious ſouls. They that would take their parts in promiſed comforts, they muſt follow the voice of the Word, and ſubſcribe to the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of conſcience, following that Word. If the Word approve of thee, as ſound and ſincere with God, aſſuredly thou art ſo, for that rule cannot err: If the Word ſaith, that thy heart is right with God, thou muſt maintain that Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt all diſputes whatever.

                  <p>I know that the impenitent and unbelieving perſon that lives and dies without grace in his heart, and an intereſt in Chriſt, ſhall as certainly be damned, as if I ſaw him this very moment under everlaſting burnings; becauſe God in the Scripture has ſaid it, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>John</hi> 3.18.36. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4, 5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19, 20, 21. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. And I know that the holy, humble, true, peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, believing, ſelf-denying, and ſin-mortifying Chriſtian,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52491:33"/> ſhall be as certainly ſaved, as if at this very time I ſaw him in an actual poſſeſſion of glory; becauſe God in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture has ſaid it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.3-12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1.13. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.15, 16, 36. Chap. 6.37, 38, 39, 40, &amp;c. O Sirs, no man in his wits dares diſpute againſt the Authority of Scripture, or deny it as falſe and erronious; and therefore if the Scripture ſay, a man has grace, he ought in conſcience to ſubſcribe to it againſt all objections or temptations to the contrary. For ever remember this; Till a man comes to be willing to have his ſpiritual and eternal eſtate to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by Scripture, he will never enjoy any ſetled reſt or quiet in his ſpirit. When once the goodneſs of a mans eſtate is cleared up to him by the Word, he is never to regard what Satan or carnal reaſon objects againſt him; Satan is a lyar and a deceiver, of neer ſix thouſand years ſtanding; he is full of envy, and full of malice, and full of wiles, devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and fetches, and therefore give no credit to any of his reports againſt the report of the Word, but ſtand by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the Word, and the witneſs of your own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, againſt all Satans cavils, temptations, objections and ſuggeſtions; and then, and not till then, will you find reſt to your ſouls. He that would hold on cheerfully and reſolutely in a Chriſtian courſe, and go merrily to his grave, and ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to heaven, he muſt maintain the teſtimony of the Word againſt all the gainſayings of ſenſe or carnal reaſon, he muſt hear nothing, nor believe nothing againſt the Word, nor againſt the goodneſs and happineſs of his own eſtate or condition, which has been evidenced to him from the Word. Men will not be eaſily baffled out of their eſtates: If ſome great man ſhould come and lay claim to your eſtates, you will not preſently give them up, though your evidences are not at hand, or though they are blotted, or though perhaps you cannot clearly make out your title, yet you will not tamely and quietly give up your eſtates; and yet how ready are many Chriſtians, upon every clamour of Satan againſt their ſouls and ſpiritual eſtates, to give up all, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that they are hypocrites, and have no true grace and ſpiritual life in them! &amp;c.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, A gracious ſoul may argue thus; All the great and precious promiſes concerning everlaſting happineſs and bleſſedneſs, are made over to faith and repentance, as the Scriptures do abundantly evidence: Now, he that really finds faith and repentance wrought in his ſoul, ſo that he is able to ſay, I am a repenting and a believing ſinner, he may truly and ſafely conclude, that he ſhall be ſaved; for all the promiſes of eternal happineſs and bleſſedneſs, do run out with a full ſtream to faith and repentance: I readily grant, that a ſtrong hope reſults from the clear evidence it hath of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52491:34"/> both theſe. We read in Scripture of a threefold aſſurance: As firſt, an aſſurance of underſtanding, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.2. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, an aſſurance of faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. Thirdly, an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of hope, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.11. And 'tis a very choice note, that acute <hi>D. A.</hi> hath upon it, <hi>viz.</hi> That theſe three make up one practical Syllogiſm, wherein knowledge forms the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, faith makes the aſſumption, and hope draws the concluſion. I do (ſaith the Chriſtian) aſſuredly know from the Word that can't deceive me, That the believing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting ſinner, ſhall be ſaved, my conſcience alſo tells me, that I do unfeignedly believe and repent, therefore I do firmly hope, that I ſhall (how ever vile and unworthy (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe) be ſaved. Now mark, anſwerable to the evidence that a man hath in his own ſoul, that faith and repentance is wrote in him; ſo will his hope and aſſurance be weaker or ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, more or leſs. If a mans evidence for the truth of his faith and repentance be dark, and weak, and low, and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, his hope and aſſurance that is born of theſe parents (as I may ſay) muſt needs partake of its parents weakneſs and infirmities, and be it ſelf weak, and dark, and low, and wavering, and uncertain, as they are from which it reſults; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ope and aſſurance ebbs and flows, as the evidence of a mans faith and repentance ebbs and flows.</p>
                  <p>Aſſurance can't be ordinarily had without a ſerious exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of our own hearts, for aſſurance is the certain knowledge of the concluſion drawn from the premiſes, one out of Scripture, the other by a reflect act of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or conſcience, thus: He that believes and repents ſhall certainly be ſaved, that is the voice of the Word of God; then by the ſearch of a mans own heart, he muſt be able to ſay, but I believe and repent, and from theſe two doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult this aſſurance, that he may ſafely conclude, therefore I ſhall be ſaved.

Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber once for all, <hi>viz.</hi> that a pure heart is ſuch a one as hath caſt off and caſt out the love and allowance of every known ſin, and mingles not with it, though never ſo ſmall; ſuch a heart as hath renounced every known way of ſin, though there is corruption remaining in it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet it can ſolemnly and ſeriouſly appeal to God, that there is no known way of ſin, but it hates, and abhors, and ſtrives againſt, and will up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no terms allow of.

Evangelical purity of heart lies in this, that it will not admit any known ſin to mingle with the frame and purpoſe of the heart; a pure heart like a pure fountain, will ſtill be a working and a caſting out the mud and filth that is in it: Though ſin may cleave to a regenerate man, as droſs doth to the ſilver, yet it mingles not with the regenerate part, nor the regenerate part mingles not with it, no more than oyl mingles with the water, or water mingles with the oyl. Now you know, though the water and the oyl touch one another, yet they do not mingle one with another; ſo though grace and ſin, in a regenerate man, may as it were, touch one another, yet they don't mingle one with another. Dear hearts, look, as we truly ſay, that that gold is pure gold that is digged out of the Mineral, though much droſs may hang about it; and as we truly ſay, that ſuch and ſuch an Air is pure Air, though at times there be many fogs and miſts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it; and as we truly ſay, that ſuch and ſuch ſprings are pure ſprings, though mud, and dirt, and filth may be lying at the bottom of thoſe ſprings; and as we truly ſay, that face is a fair face, though it hath ſome freckles in it; ſo we may as truly ſay, that ſuch and ſuch a heart is a pure heart, though there may be much ſinful droſs and filth cleaving to it.

Look as thoſe beaſts, in that, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.12. had their dominion taken away, though their lives were ſpared and prolonged for a ſeaſon and a time; ſo when Chriſt and grace enters into the ſoul, they take away the dominion of ſin, though they do for a time ſpare the life of ſin. To prevent miſtakes, premiſe with me briefly theſe few things. Firſt,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> that in every regenerate man there are two men, an old man and a new man; or if you pleaſe, fleſh and ſpirit. Secondly, The old man, the fleſhly part, will incline the ſoul, and byaſs the ſoul, as well to ſins againſt the Goſpel, as to ſins againſt the Law, and to great ſins as well as to ſmall ſins, witneſs <hi>Noah's</hi> drunkenneſs, <hi>Lot's</hi> inceſt, <hi>Aſſur's</hi> oppreſſion, <hi>David's</hi> murder and adultery, <hi>Solomon's</hi> idolatry, and <hi>Peters</hi> blaſphemy. Thirdly, The old man, the fleſhly part is as much in the will, as in any other part of the regenerate man; and therefore, when he falls into hainous ſins, he may fall into them with conſent, delight and willingneſs, ſo far as his will is unrenewed.<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5 22.</note> Though a real Chriſtian be chang'd in every part, yet 'tis but in part,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52491:41"/> and imperfect. Fourthly, The old man, the fleſhly part is in a regenerate mans members, as well as in his will, and therefore they may be exerciſed and imployed in and about thoſe ſins they have conſented unto. Fifthly, High ſinnings do waſte and wound the conſcience of a regenerate man, and lay him open to the ſore rebukes of God, and call for great repentance, and freſh and frequent applications of the bloud of Chriſt.

Sin is no King, but a Tyrant in the ſouls of the Saints, and therefore their wills ſo far as they are renewed, can't but riſe againſt it. O Sirs, remember this for ever, that the moleſting, vexing and tempting power of ſin, does not ſpeak out its dominion; for ſin may moleſt, and vex, and tempt as an enemy, where it doth not rule and reign as a King; as you ſee this day in many Nations of the earth, there are many enemies that do moleſt, vex and tempt the ſubjects of thoſe Nations, who yet are far enough off from having any rule or dominion over them; but then ſin is in dominion, when it commands in the heart as a King in his Throne, or as a Lord in his houſe, or as a General in his Army, freely, boldly, univerſally, cheerfully; and when
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52491:42"/> the ſoul doth as freely, boldly, univerſally and cheerfully ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it ſelf to ſins commands; where men commonly yield up their wills and affections to the commands of ſin, there ſin reigns; and this is the caſe of every unregenerate man; but where the will does commonly make a ſtout oppoſition to ſin, there it reigns not; now this is the caſe of every regenerate man.

Look, as we groundedly conclude, that ſuch men are under the reign and dominion of that King, that they readily, reſolvedly and habitually take up arms to fight for; ſo when the inward faculties of the ſoul, and the outward members of the body, do readily reſolve and habitually take up arms to fight for ſin, then and there ſin is in dominion, as you may plainly ſee by conſulting the Scriptures in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent;<note place="margin">Rom. 6.19, 20.

                  <p>Seventhly, When ſin commonly riſes by oppoſition, then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> it reigns.

Now doubtleſs there is not the weakeſt Chriſtian in the world, but can venture himſelf upon ſuch an appeal to God as this is, and without all peradventure, where ſuch a frame and temper of ſpirit is, there the dominion of Jeſus Chriſt is ſet up; and where the dominion of Chriſt is ſet up, there ſin has no dominion;<note place="margin">Mat. 6.24.</note> but where the dominion of Chriſt is not ſet up, there ſin is in full dominion. Chriſt's dominion cannot conſiſt with ſins dominion, nor ſins dominion cannot conſiſt with Chriſt's dominion. Now by theſe eight things, if men are not reſolved before hand to put a cheat upon their own ſouls, they may know whether their ſins have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over them or no, and ſo accordingly conclude for or againſt themſelves.

                  <p>Fifteenthly and laſtly, A godly man may argue thus.

But I walk not after the fleſh but after the ſpirit, therefore there is no condemnation to me. Walking after the fleſh, notes a courſe of ſin; and walking after the ſpirit, notes a courſe of godlineſs: Now to ſuch as keep off from a courſe of ſin, and that keep on in a courſe of godlineſs, there is no condemnation, there is not one condemnation; for God the father won't condemn ſuch a perſon, nor Jeſus Chriſt won't condemn ſuch a perſon, nor
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52491:45"/> the holy ſpirit won't condemn ſuch a perſon, nor the word of grace won't condemn ſuch a perſon, nor no commandment or threatnings will condemn ſuch a perſon, no nor ſuch a mans own heart nor conſcience (if it be rightly informed) won't condemn him; and therefore well may the holy Ghoſt ſay to ſuch a one, there is no condemnation to ſuch a one, there is not one condemnation, &amp;c.</p>

Now certainly no man can thus highly prize Grace but he that has Grace.

                  <p>But now dear hearts that this eleventh particular concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning probabilities of Grace may the better ſtick upon you, and be the more ſeriouſly minded and weighed by you, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you often to ponder upon theſe ſix following things.</p>

                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, That you have deſerved Hell, and therefore for you to have but a probability of going to Heaven, is infinite grace and mercy; you have deſerved to be ſhut up in chains of darkneſs with Devils and damned Spirits to all eternity,<note place="margin">Jude 6.</note> and therefore for you to have a probability of enjoying for ever the preſence of God,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.22, 23, 24. Iſa. 33.14.</note> Chriſt, the glorious Angels, and the Spirits of juſt men made perfect in Heaven, is a mercy more worth than ten thouſand worlds; you have deſerved to dwell with a devouring fire, and to lye for ever under thoſe flames and torments that are eaſleſs, endleſs, and remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs;<note place="margin">Pſal. 16. ult.</note> and therefore for you to have a probability of ſatiating and delighting your ſouls in that fulneſs of joy, and in thoſe everlaſting pleaſures that be at Gods right hand, is Grace, yea glorious Grace upon the Throne, &amp;c.

                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Conſider that if you caſt up a true and faithful account, you will certainly find, that the comfort, the peace, the joy, the quiet, the reſt, the ſatisfaction, the content that the generality of Saints do enjoy, is more from probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Grace, than tis from any certainty or aſſurance that they have of Grace being in their Souls; tis more from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities of an intereſt in Chriſt, than from any aſſurance of an intereſt in Chriſt; tis more from probabilities of being ſaved, than tis from any ſpecial perſwaſions that they ſhall be ſaved; tis more from probabilities of going to Heaven, than tis from any raiſed fixed confidence that they ſhall go to Heaven; and therefore the people of God have very great cauſe to bow before the Lord, and to adore his Grace, and for ever to ſpeak well of his name, for the very probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Grace, and of an intereſt in Chriſt, and of being ſaved and glorified.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Conſider that there have been very many under ſuch dreadful horrors and terrors of Conſcience, and under ſuch wrath and diſpleaſure of an angry God, and that have lain trembling upon their dying beds, and that have been even ready to be ſwallowed up in the gulf of deſpair, who would have given all the world (had it been in their power)

                     <hi>Spira</hi> being in a deep deſpair for renouncing of thoſe Doctrines of the Goſpel, which he had once ſtoutly profeſt ſaid, <hi>That he would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffer the moſt exquiſite tortures of Hell fire for the ſpace of ten thouſand years, upon condition he might be well aſſured to be releaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed afterward.</hi> He further added in that helliſh and horrible fit, that his dear wife and children (for whoſe ſake princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally he turned away from the Goſpel, to embrace this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world) appeared now to him as Hangmen, Hags and torturers. A deſpairing Soul is <hi>Magor Miſſabib,</hi> a terror to himſelf, his heart a Hell of horrour, his Conſcience an <hi>Acel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dama,</hi> a Field of black Bloud: So that as <hi>Auguſtin</hi> deſcribes ſuch a one flying from the Field to the City, from the City to his houſe, from his houſe to his Chamber, from his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to his bed, &amp;c. So that he can reſt no where, but is as if infernal Devils in fearful ſhapes were ſtill following of him, and ſtill terrifying and tormenting his diſtreſſed and perplexed Soul. Now doubtleſs ſuch poor ſouls would have given ten thouſand worlds (had they ſo many in their hands to give) and that for the very probabilities of Grace; and how many tempted, deſerted, clouded, wounded, and benighted Souls are there, who would think it a Heaven on this ſide Heaven, if they could but ſee probabilities of Grace in their Souls? O therefore let not the probabilities of Grace be a ſmall thing in your eyes, but bow the knee, and let the High Praiſes of God be found in your mouths, even for probabilities of Grace. But,</p>

Satan is an old experienced enemy, almoſt of ſix thouſand years ſtanding, and he very well knowes that probabilities of

Now the greater Satans rage is againſt the probabilities of grace, the more thankful we ſhould be for the probabilities grace; tis good to move and act croſs to him, who in all his actings loves to act croſs to the glory of God, and the good of our Souls.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, Conſider that from probabilities in outward things, men commonly gather a great deal of comfort, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, quietneſs, and ſatisfaction; when the Phyſitian tells the Patient that tis probable, yea very probable that he will recover, live and do well, O what a ſupport, comfort, and refreſhing is this to the languiſhing Patient; when there is but a probability of a good Market, how does the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſmile; when there is but a probability of good Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, how does the Tradeſman cheer up; when there is but a probability of a good Voyage, how does the Merchants and the Marriners ſpirits riſe; when there is but a probability of a good Harveſt, how does the Husbandman ſing; when there is but ſome hopes, ſome probability of a Pardon for a Condemned man, how does his ſpirits revive, and how does his heart even leap and dance for joy; and ſo when a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian has but ſome hopes, ſome probabilities of grace, of an intereſt in Chriſt, and of being ſaved, he may well cheer up and maintain his ground againſt all fears and doubts, objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and temptations.

The Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly perſon tyres the Phyſitian, grieves the Miniſter, wounds
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:52491:57"/> Relations, and makes ſport for the Devil. There are 5 ſorts of perſons that the Devil makes his Aſs to ride in triumph upon, <hi>viz.</hi> the ignorant perſon, the unbelieving perſon, the proud perſon, the hypocritical perſon, and the Melancholy perſon. Melancholy is a diſeaſe that works ſtrange paſſions, ſtrange imaginations, and ſtrange concluſions. It unmans a man, it makes a man call good evil, and evil good, ſweet bitter, and bitter ſweet, light darkneſs, and darkneſs light. The diſtemper of the body oftentimes cauſeth diſtemper of ſoul, for the Soul followeth the temper of the body. A Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly ſpirit is a dumb ſpirit, you can get nothing out of him,<note place="margin">Mat. 9.28, 29. It is no more wonder to ſee a Melancholy man doubt and queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſpiritual condition, than it is to ſee a child cry when he is beaten, or to hear a ſick man groan, or to hear a drowning man call out for a boat. You may ſilence a Melancholy man, when you are not able to comfort him. Whileſt <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was under the power of a deep Melancholy, he could not tell whether he was a man or a Beaſt. Melancholy is the mother of fears, doubts, diſputes, and diſcomforts.</note> and a deaf ſpirit, you can get nothing into him. Now of all the evil ſpirits we read of in the Goſpel, the dumb and the deaf were the worſt; darkneſs, ſadneſs, ſolitarineſs, heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, mourning, &amp;c. are the only ſweet deſirable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful companions of melancholy perſons. Melancholy makes every ſweet bitter, and every bitter ſeven times more bitter: the melancholy perſon is marvellouſly prone to bid ſleep farewel, and joy farewel, and meat farewel, and friends farewel, and Ordinances farewel, and duties farewel, and Promiſes farewel, and Miniſters farewel, and his Calling farewel, and tis well if he be not even ready to bid God farewel too. Melancholy perſons are like Idols that have eyes but ſee not, and tongues but ſpeak not, and ears but hear not. Melancholy turns truths into Fables, and fables into truths; it turns fancies into realities, and realities into fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. Melancholy is a fire that burns inwards, and is hard to quench. Now if a Chriſtian be under the power of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or accidental Melancholy, his work is not now to be a trying his eſtate, or a caſting up of his accounts to ſee what he is worth for another world, but to uſe all ſuch wayes and means as God hath prepared in a natural way for the cure of Melancholy; for as the Soul is not cured by natural cauſes, ſo the body is not cured by ſpiritual Remedies. Now in the ſeven caſes laſt mentioned, a Chriſtians work lyes rather in mourning, ſelf-judging, ſelf-loathing, ſelf-abhorring, and in repenting and reforming, and in freſh and frequent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of Faith on the Lord Jeſus, on his Blood, on his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,

So many of the dear children of God have ſincerity in their hearts, though for the preſent they do not ſee it nor know it. O Sirs! tis Chriſts work, not Graces, to evidence it ſelf ſo clearly and fully to our eyes, as to enable us to own it; tis one thing for the Spirit of God to work Grace in the Soul, and another thing for the Spirit to ſhine upon his own work; now till the Spirit ſhines upon his own work, the Soul is in the dark,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.12.</note> the Graces of the Spirit are beſt ſeen in the light of the Spirit, as we ſee the Sun beſt by his own light: Tis good for doubting Chriſtians when they are in the dark, to hold faſt this concluſion, <hi>viz.</hi> that they may be upright, though at preſent they are not able to ſee their up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs.

O Sirs! remember this once for all, that as you muſt never admit of any Arguments, Pleas, or Reaſonings for the comfort peace and refreſhment of your ſouls, but ſuch as are attended with the evidence of clear Scripture; but ſuch as are backt with pregnant Scriptures: So you muſt never admit of any Pleas, Arguments or Reaſonings, to trouble, vex, perplex, and diſquiet the peace of your ſouls, but ſuch as are attended with clear Scripture evidence, but ſuch as are well backt with Canonical Scripture. Now if this choice Rule were but wiſely obſerved, and carefully, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and conſcientiouſly practiſed by many weak doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trembling Chriſtians, how would it ſet them at liberty from their fears, doubts, and miſgivings of heart; how would it knock off all their chains, and wipe all tears from their eyes, and remove that ſadneſs that lyes like a load upon their hearts, and how ſoon would it bring them into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of peace, comfort, quietneſs, and ſettlement. O Sirs! every working and appearance of hypocriſy, doth not preſently prove the perſon in whom it is to be an Hypocrite. A man may be hypocritical either 1. Really. Or 2. In Opinion and fancy, many of the dear children of God are very apt and prone many times both to ſuſpect and falſly charge the true eſtate of their ſouls. A child in a diſtemper may queſtion the inheritance which is entailed on him, &amp;c. But remember this, if thy heart be upright, all comfort is thy portion, for as our diſtruſtful fears do not prejudice the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52491:59"/> reality of the eſtate of grace. So our frequent ſuſpitions that we are hypocrites, does not cut us off from the title and right of promiſed comforts. Chriſtians muſt carefully di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between the preſence of hypocriſy, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancy of hypocriſy. In the moſt upright hearts that are in the world, there is more or leſs hypocriſy remaining in them: All the Saints that ever were in the World,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.22, 23.

Where the ſtanding frame and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral bent of a mans heart is upright, there the preſence of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy cannot denominate a man an hypocrite. All men muſt ſtand and fall for ever according to the ſtanding frame and general bent of their hearts; if the ſtanding frame and general bent of their hearts be ſincere, they are happy for ever; but if the ſtanding frame and general bent of their hearts be hypocritical, they are miſerable for ever.

                  <p>FIfteenthly, Conſider in judging of your ſelves, and your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> ſpiritual eſtates and conditions, you muſt alwayes have an eye to your natural tempers, complexions, conſtitutions, and inclinations, and the ſins and temptations that theſe do lay you moſt open too, and remember that as in ſome tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers a little grace makes a very great ſhew; ſo in other tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52491:61"/> a great deal of grace makes but a very little ſhew.<note place="margin">A little gold ring upon an Alabla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter hand, makes a more glorious ſhew than a very great Ring upon a leprous hand; the Application is eaſy.</note> A little water in a long narrow mouth'd glaſs ſeems to be a great deal, when ten times, yea twenty times as much in a large Ciſtern is hardly diſcernable; the application is eaſie. A little Sugar will ſerve well enough for ſweet Wines, but much more is requiſite to ſweeten that Wine that is ſharp and harſh. A little grace will make a very glorious ſhew in ſuch men and women whoſe very natural tempers are ſweet, ſoft, gentle, meek, affable, courteous; when a great deal of Grace is hardly diſcernable in thoſe men and women whoſe very natural tempers are croſs, crooked, cholerick, fierce, paſſionate, ruff and unhewen. As a good man ſaid of an eminent light now in Heaven, <hi>That he had Grace enough for ten men, but ſcarce enough for himſelf,</hi> his natural temper was ſo bad, which he would himſelf often lament and bewail, ſaying to his friends, <hi>That he had ſuch a croſs crooked nature, that if God had not given him grace none would have been able to have lived one day quietly with him.</hi> A ſincere Chriſtian may have more roughneſs of nature, and more ſturdineſs of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions than is in many a moral man; he that hath more Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, may have leſs Morality, as there is more perfection of animal and ſenſitive faculties in ſome bruits than in ſome men. Tis an old experienced truth, that thoſe ſins are with the greateſt pains, labour, travel and difficulty ſubdued and mortified, which our natural tempers, complexions and conſtitutions do moſt ſtrongly incline and diſpoſe us to, and were but thoſe luſts ſubdued and brought under, it would be no difficult thing to bring all other ſins to an under; when <hi>Goliah</hi> was ſlain, the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> fled; when a General in an Army falls,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 17.51, 52.</note> the common Souldiers are quickly routed.

                  <p>SIxteenthly, Conſider, If you cannot, if you dare not ſay <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> that you have grace,<note place="margin">Mark 4.26, 27, 28.</note> yet do not ſay that you have no Grace, for the being of Grace in the ſoul is one thing, and the ſeeing of Grace in the Soul is another thing. A man may have Grace, and yet not know that he has Grace, he may have a ſeed of God in him, and yet not ſee it;<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.13.</note> he may believe, and yet not believe that he does believe; the child lives before it knows that it lives. If you cannot ſay that your Graces are true, yet do not ſay they are counterfeit, leſt you bear falſe witneſs againſt the real work of the Spirit in you. There are none ſo apt to queſtion the truth of their Grace as thoſe are that are truly gracious; though Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan cannot hinder the holy Spirit from working true grace in the Soul,<note place="margin">1 John 4.4. Pſal. 77.</note> yet he will do all he can to fill the Soul with fears and doubts and jealouſies about the truth of that grace that the holy Spirit has wrought in it. When did you ever know the Devil to tempt an Hypocrite to believe that his Graces were not true, and that certainly he had not the root of the matter in him; if you cannot ſay that you have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt, yet do not ſay that you have no intereſt in Chriſt, for a man may have an intereſt in Chriſt, and yet not ſee his intereſt in Chriſt, not know his intereſt in Chriſt; there are many precious Chriſtians that walk in darkneſs, who yet have an intereſt in that Jeſus that is all Light, Life,<note place="margin">Iſa. 50.10.</note> and love; if you cannot ſay that your pardon is ſealed in the Court of your own Conſcience, yet do not ſay that tis
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52491:62"/> not ſealed in the Court of Heaven, for many a Chriſtian has his pardon ſealed in the Court of Heaven,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.</note> before tis ſealed in the Court of his own Conſcience. A Pardon ſealed in the Court of Conſcience,<note place="margin">Rev. 2.17.</note> is that new name and white ſtone which God does not give to every one at firſt Converſion; God will take his own time to Seal up every Chriſtians Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in his boſome. If you cannot ſay that your name is written in the Book of life, yet do not ſay that tis not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Book of life; the Diſciples names were firſt writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Heaven before Chriſt bid them rejoyce,<note place="margin">Luke 10.20.</note> becauſe their names were written in Heaven. A man may have his name written in Heaven, and yet it may be a long while before God may tell him that his name is written in Heaven. I you cannot ſay that the precious Promiſes are yours, yet do not ſay that they are childrens Bread, and ſuch dainties that your Soul ſhall never taſt of; tis not every precious Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an that has an intereſt in the Promiſes,<note place="margin">Pſal. 77. Pſal. 88. 1 Pet. 1.4.</note> that can run and read his intereſt in the Promiſes. If you cannot ſay that the heavenly inheritance is yours, yet do not ſay that tis not yours, do not ſay it ſhall never be yours. A Chriſtian may have a good title to the heavenly inheritance, and yet not be able to make good his title, to clear up his title; as a child in the arms or in the Cradle, may be heir to a Crown, a Kingdom, and yet he is not able to make good his title. If you cannot ſay that you have Aſſurance, yet do not ſay that you ſhall never have Aſſurance, for a man may want Aſſurance one year, and have it the next; one Moneth, and have it ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;<note place="margin">Luke 19.1-10.

                  </head>
                  <p>SEventeenthly, When ever you caſt your eye upon your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> gracious evidences, it highly concerns you ſeriouſly to remember that you have to deal with God in a Covenant of Grace, and not in a Covenant of Works. Every breach of peace with God, is not a breach of Covenant with God. Though the Wife hath many weakneſſes and infirmities hanging upon her, and though ſhe may often grieve, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke and diſpleaſe her Husband, yet as long as ſhe remains faithful, and truly loving, and in the main obedient to him, though he may alter his carriage towards her,<note place="margin">Jer. 3.12, 14, 22. Hoſ. 14.4. Iſa. 43.22. to 26. ch. 57.16, 17, 18, 19. Every thing which is a ground of grief or ſorrow to the people of God, is not a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground of queſtioning their integrity, or the goodneſs and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of their ſpiritual eſtates and conditions. If upon every ſlip, failing and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, a Chriſtian ſhould queſtion all that ever was wrought in him, and done by God upon him, his life will certainly be made up of fears and doubts, and he will never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to any ſetled peace, comfort, or aſſurance or be able to live that life of joy, praiſe, and thankfulneſs that the Goſpel calls for.</note> yet he will not withdraw his love from her, or deny his relation to her. No more will God towards his weak miſcarrying ones, as you may evidently ſee by comparing the Scriptures in the Margent together. Doubtleſs there are many dear Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans whoſe troubles of Conſcience about their ſpiritual and eternal eſtates, ariſes from their looking upon God, and dealing with God in a Covenant of Works. Are there not many precious Chriſtians, who when they fall before temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and are worſted by their corruptions, that are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to queſtion all, and throw up all as loſt, and peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to conclude againſt their own Souls, that all is naught, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry naught, ſtark naught, and that they are Hypocrites, and that God will never own ſuch as they are, nor never accept of ſuch as they are, nor never delight in ſuch as they are, nor never have any thing to do with ſuch as they are, and all this becauſe they do not a right underſtand the Covenant of Grace, and think that they have to deal with God in a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works. Though many Chriſtians do freely and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily acknowledg that there is a Covenant of Grace, yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the leaſt ſtirring of any corruption, or the leaſt conqueſt that is made upon them by the violence of any temptation, they are ſo full of fears, faintings, reaſonings, diffidences, and deſpondencies, &amp;c. And they carry it ſo weakly and unworthily towards the Lord, as if there were no Covenant
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52491:63"/> of Grace at all, or as if they had wholly and only to deal with God in a Covenant of works. Now what a high diſhonour is this to the free, rich, infinite, ſovereign, and glorious Grace of God, which ſo ſparkles and ſhines in the Covenant of Grace, and which tells us that our eternal eſtates ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be judged by a Covenant of Works, and that the want of an abſolute perfection ſhall never damn a believing Soul, and that the obedience that God requires at our hands, is not a Legal, but Evangelical? O that all thoſe dear Chriſtians who are ſo apt to be dejected and overwhelmed upon the account of the prevalency of ſuch and ſuch corruptions, and becauſe they fail in keeping Covenant with God, and in wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in a Covenant-relation with God, I ſay, O that all theſe would frequently and ſeriouſly conſider of theſe three things!</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, That ſo long as a Chriſtian doth not renounce his Covenant with God, ſo long as he doth not wilfully and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly break the bond of the Covenant, the ſubſtance of the Covenant is not yet broken, though ſome Articles of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant may be violated, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.30. to 35. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. (while Chriſt lyes at the bottom of the Covenant, it cannot be utterly broken) As among men there be ſome treſpaſſes againſt ſome particular clauſes in Covenants, which though they be violated, yet the whole Covenant is not forfeited; tis ſo here, every jar, every miſcarriage doth not break the Marriage-Covenant; no more doth every ſin, every miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage break the Covenant between God and the Soul.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Seriouſly conſider that many weak Chriſtians are much miſtaken about the terms and condition of the Covenant of Grace, they think that the condition of the Covenant is perfect and unſinning, obedience, whereas tis only ſincere obedience.<note place="margin">Iſa. 54. Iſa. 7.8, 9, 10. Jer. 31.33, 34, 35, 36, 37.</note> Mark, that man ſincerely obeyes and ſincerely walks in Covenant with God, who ſincerely, who heartily, who ordinarily deſires, labours, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to obey the Law of God, the will of God, and to walk in Covenant with God. Mark, particular actions do not denominate any eſtate, it is the courſe of actions which doth
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52491:63"/> denominate a mans walking in Covenant with God, or his not walking in Covenant with God; if his courſe of actions be ſinful, he walks not in Covenant with God; but if his courſe of actions be holy and gracious, he walks in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God. Though the needle of the Seamans Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs may jog this way, and that way, yet the bent of the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle will ſtill be Northward; ſo though a Chriſtian in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God may have his particular ſinful joggings, this way or that way, yet the bent of his heart will ſtill be to walk in Covenant with God. But,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Conſider that infirmities, aberrations of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> do not nullify or evacuate our Covenant with God, nor hinder our walking in Covenant with God; for if they ſhould, then no man could poſſibly keep Covenant with God, or walk in Covenant with God; Infirmities God paſſes by and pardons in courſe, and will never put them into the account, and therefore they cannot hinder our walking in Covenant with God. Breaches made in the firſt Covenant were irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable, but breaches made in the Covenant of Grace are not ſo, becauſe this Covenant is eſtabliſhed in Chriſt, who is ſtill a making up all breaches. Mark, there are five things which ſhew that the deviations of Gods people are only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and not enormities, weakneſſes, and not wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; and the firſt is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That they do frequently and principally ariſe from the ſubtilty and ſudden power of Satans temptations. 2.<note place="margin">1 Chron. 21.1. Rom. 7.15, 16, 19, 23, 24.</note> That the frame of their ſpirits is againſt the evil that they do. 3. Their daily cries, tears, and complaints, ſpeaks it out to be an infirmity, they are in this particular like a loſt ſheep, or a loſt child, or a loſt friend. 4. Though they do fall, yet they riſe again, though they do ſtep or wander out of the way, yet they do return into the right way again. 5. When they do fall, there is a vaſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, a mighty difference between their falls, and the falls of wicked men that are not in Covenant with God, and that firſt, in reſpect of willingneſs. 2. In reſpect of choice. 3. In reſpect of affection. 4. In reſpect of courſe. 5. In reſpect of quietneſs. 6. In reſpect of continuance. Mark, When wicked men fall, when men out of Covenant with
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52491:64"/> God fall, then they fall willingly, they fall out of choice, they fall out of affection to fall, they fall in a courſe, they fall, and they are quiet under their falls; they fall, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to fall,<note place="margin">Iſa. 55.12.</note> to morrow ſhall be as to day. But perſons in Covenant with God, though they do fall, yet they do not fall, nor cannot fall as they do that are out of Covenant with God. For firſt, There is in all ſuch perſons an habitual pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to keep Covenant with God. 2. An habitual deſire to keep Covenant with God. 3. An habitual reſolution to keep Covenant with God. 4. An habitual endeavour to keep Covenant with God. Now where tis thus, there that man is certainly in Covenant with God, and that man walks in Covenant with God, he is under a Covenant of Grace, his ſins are pardoned, and therefore they ſhall never be his ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine.<note place="margin">Iſa. 63.17.</note> Doubtleſs many precious Chriſtians have charged and condemned themſelves for thoſe things that the great God will never charge them with, nor condemn them for. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Bradford</hi> wrote himſelf an Hypocrite, a painted Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, but doubtleſs God will never bring in ſuch a charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. O Sirs, the ſtirrings of ſin, and the workings of ſin, and the prevalency of ſin, for particular acts will ſtand with the Covenant of Grace, though not with the Covenant of Works. You may not by any means conclude that you are not in a Covenant of Grace, becauſe ſuch and ſuch cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions ſtirs in you, or becauſe ſuch or ſuch weakneſſes now and then breaks forth and diſcovers themſelves, either in your lips or lives: Did Chriſtians but ſtudy the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace more, and underſtand better than they do the difference between the Covenant of grace and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, how would their fears and doubts about their ſpiritual and eternal eſtates vaniſh, as the clouds before the Sun when it ſhines in its greateſt ſtrength and glory, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>'Twas the ſaying of an eminent Miniſter on his death-bed, That he had much peace and quietneſs, not ſo much from a greater meaſure of grace than other Chriſtians had, or from any immediate witneſs of the ſpirit, but becauſe he had a more clear underſtanding of the Covenant of grace than many others, having ſtudyed it, and Preached it ſo many

There was a man well known to a Miniſter in this City, who in the time of his ſickneſs was ſo terrified in his Conſcience for his ſins, that he made the very bed to ſhake upon which he lay, and cryed out all night long, <hi>I am damn'd, I am damn'd, I am damn'd;</hi> and this man in the dayes of his outward and inward diſtreſſes, made many and great proteſtations of amendment of life, if God would be pleaſed to recover him; in a little while he did recover, and being recovered, he was as bad, and as wicked, if not worſe than he was before. So in the time of the great ſweat in King <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes, as long as the heat of the Plague laſted, all ſorts and ranks of people were ſtill a crying out, <hi>Peccavi; Mercy good Lord, Mercy, Mercy, Mercy!</hi> Then Lords and Ladies, and other perſons of quality cryed out to the Miniſters, <hi>For Gods ſake tell us what we ſhall do to avoid the Wrath of God, take theſe bags, pay ſo much to ſuch a one whom I have deceived, and ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore

But now a godly man (when he is himſelf) he is never unwilling to be rid of his ſins, yea, to be rid of all his ſins, the fixed, ſtanding, and abiding diſpoſition and bent of a godly mans Soul, of a godly mans will, is to be rid of every ſin; and thrice happy is that man that is habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally under ſuch a choice and bleſſed frame.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A tranſcendent willingneſs, a ſuperlative wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> an overtopping willingneſs to be rid of ſin, is an infallible evidence of the truth of Grace in the Soul.

A gracious heart had much rather, if it were put to his choice, live without all ſin, than to have allowance to

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52491:70"/> Kings Highway. So the buſineſs, the work of an upright man is to depart from evil; 'tis poſſible for an upright man to ſtep into a ſinful path, or to touch upon ſinful facts; but his main way, his principal work and buſineſs, is to depart from iniquity: As a Bee may light upon a Thiſtle, but her work is to be gathering at Flowers; or as a Sheep may ſlip into the dirt, but its work is to be graſing on the Mountains, or in the Meadows. Certainly there is no man in the world ſo abominable wicked, but that he may now and then (when he is in a good mood, or when he is under diſtreſs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or bleeding under a ſmarting rod, or beholding the hand-writing upon the Wall, or under a ſentence of death) depart from evil; but this is not his courſe, this is not his buſineſs, this is not his work, this is not his highway. Thieves do but now and then ſtep into the Kings Highway to take a purſe, they do not keep the Kings Highway. But now the upright mans Highway, his common and ordinary courſe, is to depart from evil, and therefore he cannot allow himſelf liberty to walk in an evil way. <hi>Titus</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>For the Grace of God that bringeth Salvation, hath appeared to all men,</hi> (without diſtinction of Nations, Sex, Age, or condition) <hi>teaching us, that denying ungodlyneſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent World.</hi> Under the name of ungodlineſs, he compriſeth all the breaches of the firſt Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and under the name of worldly luſts, he compriſeth all inordinate deſires againſt the ſecond Table; and thoſe three words, ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly, have a threefold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; the firſt to our ſelves, the ſecond to our neighbour, and the third to God.

True Grace makes oppoſition as well againſt the being of ſin in a mans nature,<note place="margin">Col. 3.5.</note> as againſt the breakings out of ſin in a mans life. True Grace will make head againſt the corruptions of the heart, as well as againſt the excurſions of the feet; 'tis as willing and deſirous to be rid of a polluted heart, as 'tis wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and deſirous to be rid of a polluted hand. It would fain have, not only ſinful acts, but alſo ſinful diſpoſitions; and not only irregular actions, but alſo inordinate affections mortified and ſubdued. O friends! heart-ſins are root-ſins, they are the ſprings that ſet all the wheels a going, the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that ſets all the ſtreams a running, the fire that ſets the Furnace a ſmoaking, the Bellows that ſets the fire a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Certainly a proud heart hath more of Satan in it than a proud look, and a wanton heart is more vile than a wanton eye, and a murtherous or adulterous heart, is worſe than a murtherous or adulterous act, &amp;c. And therefore true grace makes head againſt heart-ſins, againſt ſpiritual ſins,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52491:71"/> againſt the moſt inward ſecret ſins, againſt thoſe very ſins that lye not within the reach of reaſon, or the Sword of the Magiſtrate, or the piercing eye of the moſt knowing or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving man in the World, but are only obvious to an omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcient eye. But now carnal men, as they make little of outward ſins, ſo they make nothing of heart-ſins, of ſpiritual ſins. If they are not drunkards, nor ſwearers,<note place="margin">Matt. 19.16-27.</note> nor extortio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, nor whoremaſters, nor curſers, nor cheaters, nor op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors, nor lyars, nor perſecutors; if they are good nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians, then they think themſelves very good Saints, and in a very fair way for heaven, and that no man can ſay Black is their eye; when their hearts are as full of evil thoughts, and ſecret luſts, as Ignorance, Atheiſm, unbelief, pride, envy, diſcontent, anger, formality, hypocriſy, indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency, lukewarmneſs, deadneſs and hardneſs, &amp;c. as the Sun is full of light, or as Hell is full of darkneſs. Reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace, common grace, only makes head againſt groſs enormities, againſt palpable vanities, as you may ſee in the Scribes and Phariſes; but ſaving grace makes head againſt heart-ſins, againſt ſpiritual ſins. Common grace is all for waſhing the outſide, but Saving grace is for waſhing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide as well as the outſide. Common grace is only for waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the feet and the head, but Saving grace is for waſhing both feet, head, and heart. Look as in a dark night we can only ſee thoſe ſtars that are of the greateſt magnitude;<note place="margin">Matth. 23. John 13.9, 10.</note> ſo by the ſtar-light of natural Conſcience, the natural man can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee thoſe ſins that are more great and groſs. Natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions can reach no further than natural light, but ſpiritual convictions reach to the moſt inward, ſecret, ſpiritual, and undiſcernable ſins. Certainly that is a ſincere heart, a heart more worth than gold, that ſmites a man for inward ſins as well as for outward ſins; for ſins done in a corner, as well as for ſins acted upon the houſe top; for ſpiritual ſins as well as for fleſhly ſins; for ſins againſt the Soul, as well as for ſins againſt the body; for ſins committed in a Cloſet, as well as for ſins committed on the moſt publick Stage. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that trouble and grief that ſprings from heart-ſins, from ſpiritual ſins, from ſecret ſins, bears a more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52491:72"/> relation to the holineſs of God, who only obſerves them, and is offended by them, and ſo is a moſt ſure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible evidence of ſaving Grace, and of the work of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in power upon the Soul. When open commiſſions do humble and abaſe the heart, and ſecret inclinations to ſin do even break and burſt the heart aſunder, then the heart is certainly ſincere with God. A Chriſtian will readily grant that his God is a good God, and that Jeſus Chriſt is the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of ten thouſand, and that the Goſpel is a glorious Goſpel, and that the Promiſes are precious Promiſes, and that the Ordinances are bleſſed Ordinances, and that the lively com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints is the Sweeteſt communion in all the world. But yet he will ſay, I have ſuch a proud heart, ſuch a hard heart, ſuch a flight heart, ſuch a carnal heart, &amp;c. and I am ſo vexed and moleſted with ſinful motions, and with ſinful imaginations, and with ſinful inclinations, and with Atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal riſings, and with private murmurings, and with ſecret unbelievings, and that in deſpite of all my conflictings, and ſtrivings, and prayings, and mournings, and ſighings, and groanings, and complainings; that I am oftentimes even weary of my life: And if this does not ſpeak out Chriſt within, and grace within, and the Spirit within ſuch a Soul, I know nothing. O friends! remember this once for all, <hi>viz.</hi> That the main Battle, the main warfare of a Chriſtian lyes not in the open field, it lyes not in viſible skirmiſhes, but his main quarrels and conflicts are moſt within, and his worſt and greateſt enemies are them of his own houſe, they are them of his own heart. A little grace at firſt converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may reform an ill life; but it muſt be a great deal of grace that muſt reform an ill heart. A little grace may make a man victorious over outward groſs ſins, but it muſt be a great deal of grace that muſt make a man victorious over inward ſins, ſecret ſins, ſpiritual ſins, heart-ſins, yea, a through conqueſt of theſe ſins will hold a man play all his dayes.

Had the Apoſtle ſaid that ſin might appear to be a ſnare, a Serpent, a Viper, a Toad, a Plague, a Devil, a Hell, &amp;c. he had ſaid much, but yet not enough to ſet forth the tranſcendent evil that is in ſin, and therefore he calls it ſinful ſin. All other evils are but outward, they only reach the name, the body, the eſtate, the life, but ſin is an inward evil, a ſpiritual evil, an evil that reaches the precious and immortal Soul, and therefore is the greateſt evil. Death puts an end to all other troubles, <hi>viz.</hi> poverty, ſickneſs, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, ſcorn, contempt, croſſes, loſſes, &amp;c. but ſin is ſo great an evil, that death it ſelf cannot put an end to it, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity it ſelf ſhall never put a ſtop, a period to this evil of evils. All outward evils can never make a man the ſubject of Gods wrath and hatred. A man may be poor, and yet precious in the eyes of God, he may be greatly abhorred by the World, and yet highly honoured by God; he may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed by men, and yet exalted by God. But now ſin is ſo great an evil, that it ſubjects the ſinners Soul to the wrath and hatred of God; all other evils do but ſtrike at a mans preſent well-being, but ſin ſtrikes at a mans eternal well-being; all other evils can never hinder a mans communion with God, a man may have communion with God in pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in ſickneſs, in Priſon, in Baniſhment; but ſin is ſo great an evil, that it interrupts communion with God, it cuts off

All other evils do not fight againſt the greateſt good, but ſin is that grand evil that fights againſt the greateſt good, it fights againſt the being of God, the eſſence of God, the glory of God. <hi>Peccatum eſt Dei-cidium,</hi> ſin is a killing of God, 'tis a murthering of God; Sin is a univerſal evil, 'tis all evil, 'tis nothing but evil, there is not one drop, one ſpark of good to be found in any ſin; but now in all outward evils, there is ſome good, there is ſome good in poverty, in ſickneſs, in war, in death, but there is not the leaſt good in ſin, ſin is the ſole object of Gods hatred, he hates nothing but ſin, he is angry with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſin, he has forbid nothing but ſin, he has revealed his wrath from heaven againſt nothing but ſin, ſo great an evil is ſin.

True Grace hath a real repugnancy and contrariety to all ſin; and remember this once for all, that ſaving Grace is not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſin becauſe it is open and manifeſt, nor to ſin becauſe it is private and ſecret, nor to ſin becauſe it is of this or that conſequence, but to ſin as ſin, whether publick or private, becauſe both the one and the other are contrary to the Law of God, the will of God, the glory of God, the nature of God, the deſigns of God, &amp;c. As it is with true light, though it be but a beam, yet it is univerſally oppoſite to all dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; or as it is with heat, though there be but one degree of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52491:74"/> it, yet it is oppoſite to all cold. So true Grace, it is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to all ſin, it cannot comply with any known ſin. Look as ſin and Grace were never born together, and as ſin and Grace ſhall never dye together, ſo ſin and Grace can never be reconciled together. There is a natural contrariety be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſin and Grace, and therefore you can never reconcile them in the heart. The oppoſition that Grace makes againſt ſin, is inward as well as outward, 'tis againſt ſin whereſoever it is. Nothing will ſatisfy a gracious ſoul but the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Knowing this, that our old man is Crucified with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin.</hi> The Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

So when all a Chriſtians falls do but work him to cleave the cloſer, and hang the faſter upon the ſtrength of Chriſt, and to be ſtill a drawing more and more vertue and power from Chriſt; then is the prevalency of ſin made ſerviceable to holy and gracious ends; and where God ordinarily thus works, there is certainly a work of God in power upon that Soul, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. <hi>For behold, this ſelf ſame thing that ye ſorrowed after a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſort, what carefulneſs it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of your ſelves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment deſire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge, in all things you have approved your ſelves to be clear in this matter</hi> (this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I have fully opened in my eighth ſign of godly ſorrow, in this book, and to that I refer you). The Mother by ſuffering the child to get one fall, keeps the child from many a fall, and ſo 'twas with theſe <hi>Corinthians.

Sin is no gainer, but a loſer by every fall of the Saints. God does, and will, by the over-ruling hand of his
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52491:76"/> grace, make the very miſcarriages of his people to be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inlets to more eminent degrees of Grace and holineſs. God hath a great Revenue of glory from the very infirmities of the Saints; and the Saints have a great Revenue of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from their very miſcarriages, by the wiſe, powerful, over-ruling, and ſanctifying hand of God. God is that powerful, that skilful Phyſician, that can make an Antidote, and Sovereign remedy of ſin, that is the moſt deadly poyſon in all the World. God does and will make the very ſins of his people to further the Salvation of his people, according to that golden promiſe <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. God never ſuffers his people to fall into any ſin, but out of a deſign to break the neck and back of that ſin they fall into: God ſuffered <hi>David</hi> to fall into thoſe two great ſins of Murder and Adultery, but by theſe very falls he broke the very back of thoſe ſins, for we never read that ever he fell into thoſe ſins the ſecond time. And ſo God ſuffered <hi>Peter</hi> to deny him once, but by that ſore fall God broke the neck of that very ſin, for we never read that ever he denyed Chriſt any more at the voice of a Damſel; yea, 'tis very obſervable, that <hi>Peters</hi> courage and boldneſs for the truth, received a very high advance by thoſe deep wounds that he had formerly given them, when he denyed the Lord that bought him. After his ſore falls, for courage and boldneſs he carries the Bell from all the Apoſtles, as you may ſee in <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. It is the nature of true Grace to gather ſtrength by every wound. Grace ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſtrength by contraries, as Fire doth when it is compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed about with coldneſs by an Antiper ſtaſis. By all a Ch i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians falls his graces grow brighter and ſtronger. At the long run, a Chriſtian by all his falls loſes nothing but his droſs, his chaff, his ſcum, his filth. Now he that finds his ſins thus over-ruled for the good of his ſoul, he is certainly a gracious Soul. O Sirs! remember this for ever, <hi>viz.</hi> That the oftner an Hypocrite, or a Formaliſt falls, the more ground and ſtrength his ſins get upon him, and ſo will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to do, till all that Grace and goodneſs which he ſeemed to have had, be quite extinguiſhed.

When a man can ſay to Heaven and Hell, ſtand you by for the preſent, and to preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Promiſes, ſtand you by for the preſent, and to Divine threatnings, ſtand you by for the preſent, here is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God that forbids ſuch and ſuch actions, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I cannot, I dare not do this or that wickedneſs,<note place="margin">Gen. 39.9.</note> and ſin againſt the Lord, there is certainly a principle of Grace in that mans heart.

A child does not ſtand in more awe of the rod, nor a ſervant of a beating, nor a Favourite of his Princes frowns, than a real Chriſtian (when he is himſelf) ſtands in awe of the Word.

From any Liquor of Grapes, though it were but the water wherein they were ſteeped. 4. From the green or moiſt Grape. 5. From the dryed Grape or Raiſin. 6.

It was good counſel that <hi>Liv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>It behoveth thee</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>not only not to do wrong, but not to ſeem to do ſo, &amp;c.</hi> We muſt ſhun and be ſhy of the very ſhew and ſhadow of ſin, if either we tender our credit abroad, or our comfort at home, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the power of holineſs lyes much in ſhunning the very appearance of ſin. The Primitive Chriſtians would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that any Chriſtian ſhould look towards <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe they would avoid the leaſt ſhew of Judaiſm. And indeed there are great reaſons why every Chriſtian ſhould avoid whatever may have the ſuſpition of ſin; and this will be evident, if you pleaſe but ſeriouſly to conſider of theſe eight following particulars.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Conſider thoſe clear and plain commands of God which makes this duty to be a duty, as that 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from all appearance of evil.</hi> God requires us not only to abſtain from all apparent ſins, but alſo from all appearance of ſin; we muſt do nothing which hath a ſhew or ſhadow of ſin; 'tis duty to abſtain from whatever is of an ill ſhew, or an ill report. And ſo God commands us to hate the garment ſpotted with the fleſh, <hi>Jude</hi> 23. Saints muſt abhor every thing that carries with it but a ſavour or ſuſpition of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.<note place="margin">Hence that ſaying of the Jews, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move thy ſelf from filthineſs, and from all that which hath a ſhew of it. See Druſius prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terit, in 1 Theſſ. 5.22.</note> The Apoſtle alludes to legal uncleanneſs, which was contracted by touching the houſes, the veſſels, or the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of unclean perſons, <hi>Levit.</hi> 15. Chriſtians muſt not only hate uncleanneſs, but they muſt hate every thing that looks like it, or that has the leaſt communion with it. So in that <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.30. <hi>Take heed to thy ſelf that thou be not ſnared, by following of them, after that they be deſtroyed from before thee, and that thou enquire not after their gods, ſaying, how did theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſerve their gods? even ſo will I do likewiſe.</hi> God does not only command his people to abſtain from groſs Idolatry, but he alſo commands them to take heed of all thoſe wayes and means, and enquiries that might tend to draw them to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52491:79"/> or that might carry with them the leaſt ſhew or appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Idolatry. 'Tis obſervable in the Law, that God commanded his people not only that they ſhould Worſhip no Idol, but that they ſhould demoliſh all the Monuments of them, and that they ſhould make no Covenant, nor have any affinity with thoſe who Worſhipped them; and all to avoid the very ſhews of Idolatry, and to prevent his people from being drawn by thoſe means to commit Idolatry with them. And ſo <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.7. Keep thee far from a falſe matter. Every good man muſt ſtand aloof off, he muſt keep at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance both from the occaſions of ſin, and from the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſin. So <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her houſe.</hi> He that is fartheſt from fire, is ſafeſt from burning, and he that is moſt remote from the water, is in leaſt danger of drowning. It is no ſmall wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs to approach near the door of wickedneſs; he who approaches near the door of a Whores houſe,<note place="margin">Prov. 22 14. and ch. 23.27.</note> is already in the door of whoredom. It argues too much mind to be in the houſe, for any one knowingly, willingly, to come near the door of it. O how ſhould a man dread the comming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that houſe, where he muſt needs either periſh, or elſe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come? Certainly 'tis infinite better not to be in danger of periſhing, than being in danger not to periſh. So <hi>Hoſea</hi> 4.15. <hi>Though thou</hi> Iſrael <hi>play the harlot, yet let not</hi> Judah <hi>offend, and come not ye unto</hi> Gilgal, <hi>neither go ye up to</hi> Beth-aven, <hi>nor ſwear the Lord liveth. Gilgal</hi> was once the Key of <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſcituate between <hi>Jordan</hi> and <hi>Jericho,</hi> famous for ſundry ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices there performed to God, as might be eaſily ſhewed by many inſtances; but now <hi>Gilgal</hi> was baſely abuſed to Idol-Worſhip; and hence 'tis that God charges them not to come near it, that ſo they might avoid both the ſhew and danger of Idolatry; and 'tis upon the ſame account that God charges them not to go up to <hi>Beth-aven.</hi> By theſe Scriptures 'tis evident that God would have his people to abſtain from all ſhews and appearances of ſin. But, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The holineſs of God, and the honour of God, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> calls aloud upon all Chriſtians to avoid the ſuſpition of ſin.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:52491:80"/> God is ſo eſſentially holy, ſo unmixedly holy, ſo univerſally holy, ſo eminently, ſo tranſcendently holy, ſo ſuperlatively holy, ſo originally, radically, and fundamentally holy; he is ſo Independantly holy, ſo unchangably, ſo conſtantly, and ſo exemplarily holy, that he cannot but hate and abhor the very appearance of evil. Look as apparent ſins ſtir up the judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al anger of God againſt ſinners, ſo the appearance of ſin ſtirs up the Fatherly anger of God againſt Saints. A gracious heart knows, <hi>That God is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity,</hi> Hab. 1.13. and therefore he keeps at a diſtance from the appearance of iniquity, of all men in the world none honour God at ſo high a rate as thoſe that keep moſt aloof off from the appearance of evil. Many by their apparent evils have lived God, and Chriſt, and the Goſpel, and their Profeſſion, and precious Ordinances, into diſgrace, ſcorn, and contempt; and O that we would all make it our great buſineſs, by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from all appearance of evil, to live God, and Chriſt, and the Goſpel, and our Profeſſion, and precious Ordinances, into a greater credit, praiſe, and honour than ever. He keeps fartheſt off from diſhonouring God, that keeps fartheſt off from the appearance of ſin. But, &amp;c.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rdly, This is the way of wayes for a man to keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf clear from other mens ſins, that man that abſtains from the appearance of ſin, is very rarely guilty of other mens ſins, Men many times by venturing upon the appearances of ſins, come to wrap themſelves up in the guilt of other mens ſins. Effeminate Dalliance is an appearance of evil, and had <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> been toying, and playing, and ſporting with his Miſtris in a wanton manner, how ſoon might he have wrapt himſelf up in the guilt of his Miſtreſſes burning Luſts. He that would not tempt nor entice others to ſin, muſt keep off from the very appearance of ſin. Certainly there is not the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt man in the World, but has ſins enough of his own to ſad him, though not to ſink him; to humble him, though not to damn him; to abaſe him, though not to deject him; and therefore how much does it concern the beſt men in the World to abſtain from the very appearance of ſin, that ſo
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52491:80"/> they may not bring upon themſelves the guilt and burthen of other mens ſins. 'Tis very well obſerv'd by ſome, that a more grievous puniſhment is reſerved for them which cauſe others to ſin, than for them which ſin by their occaſion; thus the Serpent was puniſhed more than <hi>Eve,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Kings 9.30-ult. compared with 1 Kings 22.34, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

To ſin (ſaith one) hath not ſo much perdition in it, as to make others to ſin; and therefore as you would never draw others to ſin, keep off from all appearance of ſin; O that all Superiours, Inferiours, and equals, would lay this counſel to heart. But,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The keeping off from all appearances of evil, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> is the beſt and nobleſt way under heaven, to keep a good Name, and to keep a good Conſcience. Now a good Name, and a good Conſcience are Jewels more worth than all the Scepters and Myters in the World, and there is no Wiſdom in the World to that which leads a man by the hand to ſecure his Name and his Conſcience, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.1. <hi>A good Name is rather to be choſen than great Riches, and loving favour rather than Silver and Gold.</hi> So <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.1. <hi>A good name is better than precious Ointment,</hi> the one being but a perſume of the Noſtrils, the other a perfume of the heart. 'Tis obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the Princely Preacher does not ſay, A great Name is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Precious Oyntments, but a good Name is better than precious Oyntments. Oyntments are here named, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in thoſe Eaſtern parts they were laid up in the Kings Treaſury, even among his moſt precious things, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 39.2. <hi>And Hezekiah was glad of them, and ſhewed him the houſe of his precious things, the Silver, and the Gold, and the Spices,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 30 22-23. Exod. 28.41. 1 Sam. 16.13. Pſal. 89.20. Heb. 1.9. Iſa. 61.3. Amos 6 6. Eſth. 2.12. Pſal. 23.5. Luke 7.46. Pſal. 92.10. Deut. 33.24. Prov. 21.20.</note> 
                  <hi>and the precious Oyntments, &amp;c.</hi> Precious Aromatical Oyntments were things greatly in uſe and eſteem amongſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and a ſpecial part of their Treaſures, as is evident by the Scriptures in the Margent. And yet a good Name (which hath its Foundation in vertue, and in a holy, innocent, blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, harmleſs, and exemplary life) is better than thoſe moſt precious Oyntments. And 'tis obſervable that the initial
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:52491:81" rendition="simple:additions"/> letter of the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Tob,</hi> that is here rendred Good, is bigger than ordinary, to ſhew the more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary excellency of a good name and fame amongſt men. 'Twas good counſel the Moraliſt gave, when he ſaid, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever commodity you loſe, be ſure yet to preſerve that Jewel of a good Name. A good renown is better than a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den girdle, ſay ſome. And a mans eye and his good Name, can bear no jeſts, ſay others. And if I may but keep a good Name, I have wealth enough, ſaid the Naturaliſt. O friends! as ever you would keep a good Name, keep off from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry appearance of evil, for the very appearance of evil will both Eclipſe and wound a mans name and his Conſcience at once. Certainly a man were better not to live, than to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live his good Name. A mans good Name is like a piece of white Paper, which if once blotted, will very hardly be got out again, ſo as to leave no Print of it behind; it is like a fair ſtructure long time a rearing, but quickly ruin'd; or like a Merchants eſtate, long a getting, but loſt in a moment. And therefore how much does it concern every Chriſtian to keep his Name as he would keep his life, and this he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do, except he keeps off from the appearance of evil. 'Tis his Name only that ſhall be kept green and flouriſhing, like the Rod of <hi>Aaron,</hi> that was laid up in the Tabernacle, who keeps off from the appearance of evil. He takes the beſt and the wiſeſt courſe under heaven to preſerve his good Name in the World, and to maintain the peace of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, who is moſt ſtudious and induſtrious to abſtain from all appearances of evil. But, &amp;c.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, The appearance of evil may very much offend, ſcandalize, ſtumble, and tempt weak Chriſtians, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it highly concerns us to keep off from the very appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of evil. The more Grace any man hath in his own heart, the more fearful he will be of ſtumbling or offending thoſe that have leſs. Venturing upon the appearance of evil, may not only defile my own Conſcience, but alſo wound my weak Brothers Conſcience, and therefore it concerns me to be very ſhy of the appearance of evil. If in things of an
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52491:81" rendition="simple:additions"/> indifferent nature, I muſt deny my own liberty,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8.11, 12, 13. chap. 10.25, 28.</note> (as I muſt) rather than grieve or offend, or wound the Conſcience of a weak Brother for whom Chriſt hath dyed. O how much more then I muſt I ſhun the very reſemblance of ſin, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how wonderful apt weak Chriſtians are to be offended, and ſtumbled, when they ſee others ſo bold as to venture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the appearance of evil. <hi>Alexanders Macedonians</hi> having offended him, laid by their Arms, put on mourning Apparel, and came running in Troops to his Tent, where, for almoſt three dayes together, they remained with loud cries and tears, to teſtify their remorſe for offending him; and ſhall we make nothing of offending thoſe weak Chriſtians that are the price of Chriſts bloud, and the travel of his ſoul, the Lord forbid.</p>
               <p>Beſides, our venturing upon the appearance of evil, may prove a great temptation to weak Chriſtians, not only to venture upon ſeeming evils, but alſo to venture upon real evils; doubtleſs many weak Chriſtians have been drawn to apparent evils, by obſerving others to venture upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of evil. 'Tis commonly ſeen, that when ſtrong Chriſtians will adventure upon appearing evils, weak Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians will be emboldned thereby to commit real evils, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.8, 9, 10. <hi>But meat commendeth us not to God, for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if we eat are we the better, neither if we eat not are we the worſe. But take heed leſt by any means this liberty of yours become a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block to them that are weak. For if any man ſee thee which haſt knowledg, ſit at meat in the Idols Temple, ſhall not the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of him which is weak, be emboldned to eat thoſe things which are offered to Idols?</hi> When the weak ſhall ſee men of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg communicating with Idolaters in their Feaſts, their Conſciences will be emboldned and confirmed in their old Superſtition about thoſe Idols, which they were beginning to leave, returning now a freſh to a more reverent eſteem and ſervice of them than ever, &amp;c. O friends, as you would not offend the weak, as you would not tempt the weak, keep off from all ſhews and appearances of evil, &amp;c. But,</p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:52491:82"/>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, Chriſtians venturing upon appearing evils, will exceedingly harden and encourage wicked men to commit real evils. 'Tis very natural and cuſtomary with wicked men to make uſe of the appearing infirmities of the Saints, as excuſes and Apologies to bear them out in their greateſt enormities and wickedneſſes. Why did not ſuch and ſuch knowing eminent Chriſtians do thus and thus! and we have gone but one ſtep beyond them, and is that ſo great and hainous a crime? they have been playing and ſporting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about the pit, and we are but ſlipt or ſtept into the pit. They have been ſitting and bibbing with ſuch and ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and we have but taken two or three merry cups more than ordinary in the ſame company, and is that ſo great a ſin? &amp;c.

Now the honour of God, and the credit of the Goſpel, ſhould be ſo dear and precious in the eyes of every Chriſtian, that he ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuſe to dye, than to venture upon the leaſt apparition of ſin, whereby the honour of God may be clouded, or the credit of the Goſpel impeached or eclipſed; or the Soul of a poor ſinner endangered or worſned; both the leaſt ſin, and the leaſt appearance of ſin muſt be avoided and prevented, the Cockatrice muſt be cruſhed in the Egg, elſe it will ſoon become a Serpent; the very thought of ſin, if not thought on, will break out into action, action into cuſtome, cuſtome into habit, and then both body and Soul are in the ready way of being irrecoverably loſt. <hi>Camerarius</hi> tells us a ſad ſtory of two Brothers, who walking out in the evening, and ſeeing the Element full of bright ſpangling Stars, one of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Graſier, wiſhed that he had as many Oxen as there were Stars in the Firmament; then ſaid the other Brother, If I had a Paſture as big as all the World, where would you keep the Oxen? he anſwered, In your Paſture: What ſaid the other, whether I would or no? Yes ſaid his Brother. The matter was very light, 'twas but a little evil, or an appearing evil, but it fell out very heavily, for preſently they fell to words, and then drew one upon another, and in the cloſe kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led one another. O friends, as you love the lives of ſinners, and as you love the Souls of ſinners, keep off from all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of evil. But,</p>

And to theſe let me add that great inſtance of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who retracted even Ironies becauſe they had the appearance of evil. And ſo the Primitive Chriſtians would not let up Lights and Bayes at their doors, though for this

Now why has God left all theſe famous Preſidents upon Record, but on purpoſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage his Saints in all Ages, to abſtain from all appearing evils, as well as from all apparent evils. Certainly God looks that we ſhould ſo eye the beſt, the higheſt, the worthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and the exacteſt examples, as that we ſhould make it our great buſineſs and work to come up to them, and to imitate them to the life.

Shall we love to look upon the Pictures of our friends, and ſhall we not much more love to look upon the holy examples of thoſe eminent Saints that had the lively picture of Grace, and the lovely Image of Chriſt fairly ſtampt upon their hearts and lives. 'Tis both our Mercy and our duty to eye the examples, and to follow the footſteps of thoſe Chriſtians that have been moſt eminent in Grace, as you may plainly ſee by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of theſe Scriptures together, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.12. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.9. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.10, 11, 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Titus</hi> 2.7.

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:52491:85"/> Certainly particular ſinnings are compatible with a gracious frame, though none are with a glorious condition. Though no darkneſs, no clouds can be mixt with the Sun in Heaven, yet both may be in the Ayre which is enlightned below. Our beſt eſtate on earth is mixt, and not abſolute. Glory annihilates all ſinful practices, but Grace only weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens them; the moſt ſincere Chriſtian is but an imperfect Chriſtian, and hath daily cauſe to mourn over his infirmities, as well as he has cauſe to bleſs God for his Graces and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. Well Sirs! Look as every particular ſtain doth not blemiſh the univerſal fineneſs of the Cloth, ſo neither doth this or that particular fact diſprove and deny the general bent of the heart; particulars may not decide the eſtate either way, 'tis true, a man by a particular ſinning is denominated Guilty, but by no one particular can a mans Eſtate be chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged, either for good or bad.

                  </gap>nly, as there is no man ſo holy, but ſometimes he falls into this or that particular ſin; So there is no man ſo wicked, but ſometimes he falls in with this or that particular duty, witneſs <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who in a fit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to pray for him; and witneſs <hi>Balaam,</hi> who in a good mood deſires to dye the death of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and witneſs <hi>Saul,</hi> who under a pang condemns himſelf, and juſtifies <hi>David.</hi> And ſo witneſs <hi>Ahabs</hi> humbling of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and <hi>Nineveh's</hi> repenting, and <hi>Foelix</hi> his trembling, and <hi>Herod's</hi> hearing of <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> gladly. Now look as every ſin which a godly man falls into (through infirmity) doth not preſently denominate him ungodly, ſo neither will a few good actions done by a wicked man prove him godly. 'Tis what the courſe and tenour of the life is, that muſt be moſt diligently and wiſely obſerved, for every man is as his courſe is; if his courſe be holy, the man is ſo; if his courſe be wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the man is wicked.

So here, as no man can ſafely and groundedly conclude from no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Promiſes than from ſome few particular actions (though in themſelves materially and ſubſtantially good) that his heart is therefore ſincere;<note place="margin">'Tis not a pang of the Soul, nor a mood, nor a fit of an Ague, nor a flaſh of Lightning nor a mans being as the morning dew, but his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual purpoſe, reſolution and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to good, that evidences the man to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally good. Pſal. 119.20. My ſoul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy Judgments at all times, &amp;c. A ſheep may ſlip into a ſlow as ſoon as a Swine; and an Apple-tree may have a fit of barrenneſs, as well as a Crab-tree. But the ſheep loves not to wallow in the Mire as the ſwine does. And though the Apple-tree be barren one year, yet it brings forth fruit the next.</note> ſo on the contrary, no man ought to conclude, becauſe of ſome groſs particular ſinful actions, and extravagant motions, that his heart is unfound. O Sirs! we are not to make a Judgment of our ſtates and conditions by ſome particular actions, whether they are good or evil, but we are to make a Judgment of our ſtates and conditions, by the general frame, bent, and diſpoſition of our hearts, and by the conſtant tenour of our lives. 'Tis certain, that God accounts every wicked man guilty of all thoſe ſins, wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and vanities, which the ſetled purpoſe, deſire, bent, bias, and frame of his Soul inclined him to, though he doth not actually commit them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.28. <hi>He that looketh on a Woman to luſt after her, hath committed Adultery already with her in his heart.</hi> A man may commit Adultery, and yet not touch a Woman. There are many thouſands that dye of the wound in the eye. So 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.15. <hi>Whoſoever hateth his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a Murtherer.</hi> A man may commit Murther, and yet not kill a man, yea he may commit Murther and yet not touch a man. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.7. <hi>For as he thinketh in his heart, ſo is he.</hi> The man is as his mind is. God eſteems of wicked men according to their hearts, and not according to their words. So 'tis as certain that the Lord accounts every god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man to do all that good, that the ſetled purpoſe, frame, bent, biaſs, and unfeigned deſires of his Soul inclines him to, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. <hi>If there be firſt a willing mind, 'tis accepted.</hi> So <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.17. <hi>By Faith</hi> Abraham <hi>when he was tryed, offered up</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and he that had received the Promiſes, offered up his only Son;</hi> that is, in diſpoſition and full purpoſe of heart, and willingneſs of mind, which God accepted for the deed; a true intent is in Gods account as a real act. So <hi>David</hi> had a purpoſe, a mind, a will to build God a houſe, and for this God commends him, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.18. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto</hi>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:52491:86"/> David <hi>my Father, whereas it was in thy heart to build a houſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Name, thou didſt well that it was in thy heart;</hi> yea, God rewards him for it, as if he had actually done it, and tells him in his ear that he would build him an houſe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.27. So when that ſervant that ow'd his Lord ten thouſand Talents, had ſhew'd his readineſs and willingneſs, and reſolvedneſs to pay all. <hi>Lord have patience with me, and I will pay thee all,</hi> Matth. 18.26. (a thing as impoſſible for him to do, as 'tis for us to keep the whole Law, and not to fail in one point; but his deſires, his mind, his will, his purpoſes was to do it) well, and what does his Lord do? why his Lord had compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on him, and looſed him, and forgave him the debt, v. 27. his Lord took this for full and current payment, he accepted of the will for the deed. So when <hi>Zacheus</hi> had unfeignedly profeſſed his purpoſe and willingneſs to make reſtitution, Chriſt preſently replies, <hi>This day is Salvation come to thy houſe,</hi> Luke 19.9. Certainly the Lord accounts that Soul a true Believer, and a bleſſed Soul, that unfeignedly deſires to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, witneſs that <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Bleſſed are they which do hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs, for they ſhall be filled.</hi> And 'tis as certain that the Lord accounts that ſinner a true penitent, that doth unfeignedly deſire, purpoſe, and reſolve to repent, to break off his ſins, and to turn to the Lord, as you may ſee in that great inſtance of the Prodigal, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.18, 19, 20. <hi>I will ariſe and go to my Father, and will ſay unto him, Father, I have ſinned againſt Heaven, and before thee, and am no more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be called thy Son, make me as one of thy hired Servants. And he aroſe and came to his Father; But when he was yet a great way off, his Father ſaw him, and had compaſſion, and ran and fell on his neck, and kiſſed him.</hi> Aſſoon as ever the Prodigal did but purpoſe and reſolve to repent, and return to his Father, the compaſſions of his Father are kindled and turned towards him, and he does not go, but runs and falls on his neck, and in ſtead of kicking and killing, there is nothing but kiſſing and embracing a returning Prodigal. God alwayes ſets a higher value upon our diſpoſitions, than upon our actions,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8.10. 1 Cor. 9.17. 1 Pet. 5.2. Exod. 25.2. Philemon 14</note> and in our beſt ſervices he eſteems more of our wills, than he does of our deeds, as is evident by the Scriptures in the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:52491:87"/> Margent. Every good man is as good in the eye and account of God, as the ordinary frame and bent of his Spirit ſpeaks him to be. Every man is as holy, as humble, as heavenly, as ſpiritual, as gracious, as ſerious, as ſincere, as fruitful, as faithful, as watchful, &amp;c. as the ſetled purpoſes, deſires, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, and endeavours of his Soul ſpeaks him to be. Hence <hi>Noah</hi> is ſaid to be a juſt man, and perfect or upright in his Generation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.9.

A child of God obeyes all the commands of God in reſpect of his ſincere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, purpoſes, reſolutions, and endeavours; and this God accepts in Chriſt for perfect and compleat obedience. This is the glory of the Covenant of Grace, that God accepts and eſteems of ſincere obedience as perfect obedience. Such who ſincerely endeavour to keep the whole Law of God, they do keep the whole Law of God in an evangelical ſenſe, though not in a legal ſenſe. In the work of Converſion,<note place="margin">Ezek. 11.19, 20.</note> God infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all Grace together, and writes not one particular Law in the hearts of his children, but the whole Law, which is a univerſal Principle, inclining the Soul impartially to all. The gracious Soul ſincerely falls in with every command of God (ſo far as he knows it), without prejudice or partiality, he dares not pick and chuſe what commands to obey, and what to reject, as Hypocrites do; he hath an eye to ſee, an ear to hear, and a heart to obey the firſt Table as well as the ſecond, and the ſecond as well as the firſt; He doth not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the firſt, and neglect the ſecond, as Hypocrites do; neither doth he adhere to the ſecond, and contemn the firſt, as prophane men do. All <hi>Sauls, Jebues, Judas's, Demas's,</hi> Scribes, Phariſes, and temporaries,<note place="margin">Matth. 23.23.</note> they are ſtill partial in their obedience, for while they yield obedience to ſome commands, they live in the habitual breach of other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. <hi>Jehu</hi> boaſtingly calls out,<note place="margin">2 Kings 10.29, 30.</note> 
                  <hi>Come ſee my zeal for the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> But if <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> had gone a little further, he might have ſeen his Calves too, contrary to Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. <hi>Herod</hi> heard <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> gladly, and did many things; but if <hi>John</hi> will be cloſe and plain with him,<note place="margin">Mark 6.</note> he ſhall then firſt loſe his liberty, and then his head for his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. A ſincere Chriſtian loves all the known Commands of God, and priſes all the Commands of God, and ſees a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Image, Majeſty, and Authority ſtampt upon all the Commands of God: And therefore the main bent and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition

                  </gap>s to obey all, and to be ſubject to all the Commands of God. Let me in a few particulars open this great truth a little more fully to you. And therefore take me thus.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, A ſincere Chriſtian will endeavour to obey God in ſuffering Commands, as well as in doing Commands, in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing as well as gaining Commands; an unſound Chriſtian, he loves cheap obedience, he is willing to fall in with thoſe Commands that are not chargable or coſtly; he loves a cheap Goſpel, and a cheap Miniſtry, and a cheap Memberſhip, and a cheap Communion of Saints, &amp;c. But when his obedience comes to be chargable, when his obedience to Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands may coſt him his health, his ſtrength, his Liberty, his Riches, his Eſtate, his Friends, his Credit, his Name, &amp;c. then he retires,<note place="margin">John 6.60.</note> then he cries out <hi>Durus ſermo,</hi> it is a hard ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who can bear it? this is a hard Commandment, who can obey it? When Religion is attended with freedom, honour, and ſafety; when Religion is attended with Riches, Pleaſures, and Applauſe, then unſound hearts will put for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; but when theſe part, then they bid Religion farewel. As you ſee in the young man in the Goſpel,<note place="margin">Matth. 19.20. to 25.</note> who was willing to follow Chriſt, ſo long as he might be no loſer in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him; but when it came to this, that he muſt part with his Riches, or with Chriſt, then he falls off, and went away ſorrowful, becauſe he had great poſſeſſions. But now a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Chriſtian will obey even the moſt chargable and coſtly Commands of God, as you may ſee in that little book of Martyrs, tenth and eleventh Chapters of the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> and as you may ſee in the three Children in <hi>Daniel,</hi> in the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,<note place="margin">Matth. 19 27.</note> in the Primitive Chriſtians, and in the Martyrs in the <hi>Marian</hi> dayes. But,</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, If your obedience ſprings from Faith, then you will endeavour to obey God in relative Commands, as well as in abſolute Commands; you will not only hear, and pray, and read, and meditate, and faſt, and mourn; but you will labour to be good in your Relations, both as a Husband, a
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:52491:89"/> Father, a Maſter, a Magiſtrate, a Miniſter. Remember this for ever, every one is that really that he is relatively. Many make a great Profeſſion, and are under a great Name, and have great parts and gifts, and can diſcourſe rarely well on any ſubject, whoſe houſes are not <hi>Bethels,</hi> but <hi>Bethavens,</hi> not little Temples, but little Hells. One, writing of the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> women, ſaith that they were Angels in the ſtreets, Saints in the Church, and Devils in their houſes; this is very appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to many high Profeſſors this day, who are very forward in the general Duties of Religion, and yet make little Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of relative duties; but he whoſe obedience ſprings from Faith, he will make Conſcience of relative commands as well as of abſolute commands: Whatever Command hath the ſtamp of God, the Authority of Heaven upon it, though it ſeem never ſo ſmall, he dares not diſobey it; if he ſees a beam of divine Majeſty ſitting upon the face of any Command, he will ſubmit to it; you know men will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe a penny if the Kings ſtamp be upon it, ſo if the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God be ſtampt upon the leaſt Command, a ſound Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian will yield ſubjection to it, as well as the greateſt. Mark, if a man make no Conſcience of relative Commands, though his general converſation as a Chriſtian be never ſo admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet he hath great cauſe to ſuſpect himſelf and his eſtate, and that his heart is not right in the ſight of God.<note place="margin">Acts 8.21.</note> O that you would ſeriouſly conſider! that relative and domeſtical Graces and duties do more demonſtrate true piety and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs than publick duties, than general duties do; for Pride, Vain-glory, Self-ends, and a hundred other outward, carnal conſiderations, may put a man upon the general du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Religion, as you may ſee by the Scriptures in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,<note place="margin">Iſa. 58.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Hoſ. 5.14. Zech. 7.4, 5, 6, 7.</note> and as you may ſee in the Scribes and Phariſes through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the New Teſtament; but it argues both truth and ſtrength of Grace to be diligent and conſcientious in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of relative duties, and this is the true reaſon why the Apoſtles in their Epiſtles, do ſo frequently, ſo earneſtly, and ſo ſtrongly, by variety of motives preſs Chriſtians to the performance of thoſe relative duties that lye upon their hands.

                  <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Ammon</hi> were baniſhed the Sanctuary to the tenth Generation, for a meer omiſſion, becauſe they met not Gods Iſrael in the Wilderneſs with bread and water. Look as the omiſſion of good diet breeds diſeaſes, ſo the omiſſion of Religious duties will either make work for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,<note place="margin">Luke 18.11.</note> or for Hell, or for the Phyſician of Souls. Mark, there is many a mans Religion lyes meerly in negatives, he is no Swearer, no Drunkard, no Adulterer, no Oppreſſor, no Defrauder, &amp;c. A formal Profeſſors obedience to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Commands, does principally lye in negatives, he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not ſo much what the Command requires, as what it prohibits, and he pleaſes himſelf rather in abſtaining from evil, than in doing of good; in being outwardly reformed, than in being inwardly renewed; he thinks it enough that he turns from ſin, though he makes no Conſcience of turning to God: If you ask him concerning affirmative Commands, there you will find him ſpeechleſs. Ask him, art thou holy? art thou humble? art thou heavenly? art thou ſincere? art thou a Believer? doſt thou ſet up God as the great object o thy fear? doſt thou love God with a ſuperlative love? is the Sabbath of the Lord a delight unto thee? &amp;c. Now here you ſtrike him dumb, he looks upon the neglect of theſe things as no ſins,<note place="margin">Iſa. 8.13. Pſal. 18.1. Iſa. 58.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Fourthly, If your obedience ſpring from Faith, then you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> will endeavour to obey God in the Spirit of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, as well as in the letter of the Command. In every Command of God there is an <hi>intra,</hi> and an <hi>extra,</hi> one part of Chriſts Law binds the Fleſh, and another part binds the Spirit, <hi>Thou ſhalt do no Murther,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 5.21.22.

The Phariſees of old did not look to the Spirit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ality of the Law, but only to the Letter of the Law; they reſted wholly upon an outward conformity to the Law, when their hearts were full of Helliſh luſts, they were all for the outſide of the Law, they regarded not the inſide of the Law; they were all for waſhing of Platters and Cups, and for beautifying of Tombs, like an Adultereſs,<note place="margin">Matth. 23.23. Phil. 3.6. Rom. 7.9. Could a man come up to all affirmative and negative Precepts in his outward converſation; yet if he were not ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual in all theſe, his obedience would be but as a body without a Soul. The Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees riſe high in their outward o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and yet Chriſt clearly and fully convinces them, that they were wretched Adulterers and Murderers, though they were not guilty of any ſuch outward crimes, &amp;c.</note> whoſe care is to paint, and ſet a fair face upon a foul matter; they were all for paying Tythe of Mint and Anniſe and Cummin; but they regarded not the inſide of the Law, they omitted the weightier matters of the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> Judgment, Mercy, and Faith. While <hi>Paul</hi> walked by the letter of the Command, he was blameleſs in his own account; but when he came to walk by the Spirit of the Command, then ſin revived, and he dyed. Friends, there are the more general duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as Hearing, Praying, Reading, Receiving, Faſting, Repeating, Diſcourſing, &amp;c. Now theſe all lye in the very letter of the Command, and there are the more inward and ſpiritual duties of Religion, as the exerciſe of Faith, fear, love, hope, joy, patience, contentation, humble ſubmiſſion, and chuſing of God, and cleaving to God, and delighting in God, and admiring of God, and exalting of God, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing hard after God, and holy Meditation, and Self-exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, &amp;c. Now all theſe lye in the very ſpirit of the Command. Now in the exerciſe of theſe more ſpiritual
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:52491:91"/> duties, our fellowſhip and communion with God mainly lyes. In the more general duties of Religion, an hypocrite may manifeſt the excellency of his gifts, but in the more ſpiritual duties of Religion, a ſincere Chriſtian doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, both the excellency and efficacy of grace. Mark, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound heart looks no further than to the bare letter of the command, to bare hearing, and bare praying, and bare preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and bare faſting, and bare giving, and bare receiving, and bare ſuffering; he looks no further than to that part of the command which only binds the fleſh, or outward man; and if he does but obſerve that in the groſs, he thinks he hath done marvellous well; like a melancholy man that matters not what melody and harmony he makes, ſo he does but touch the ſtrings of the inſtrument: But now, a found, a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Chriſtian, he looks to the Spirit of the command; and if he does not come up to that, in ſincere deſires, in graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous purpoſes, in fixed reſolutions, and in cordial endeavours, he can have no peace, no reſt, no quiet, no comfort. O Sirs! as ever you would ſee God, and enjoy God another day, you muſt labour, not only to obey the letter of the command, but alſo to bring your hearts to the ſincere obedience of the Spirit of the command. This is a very cloſe, piercing, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing and diſcovering ſign. But,</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, If your obedience ſprings from faith, then you will labour, not only to obey God in the matter, but alſo in the manner of the command, not only in the ſubſtance of the command, but alſo in the circumſtance of the command. God requires the manner as well as the matter; and God looks upon that work as not done, that is not done in a right manner. Did not the Lord command ſacrifice? and did not <hi>Cain</hi> offer ſacrifice?<note place="margin">Gen. 4.5.</note> and yet God had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to him, nor to his offering, becauſe his ſacrifice was not offered up in a right manner, his offering was not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up by a hand of faith; he offered his offering, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did not offer himſelf as an offering to God, his offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was rejected by God. A work may be materially good,<note place="margin">Luther.</note>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:52491:91"/> that is not formally and eventually good, and this was <hi>Cain's</hi> curſe. How frequently did God command the <hi>Jews</hi> to pray?<note place="margin">Iſa. 1.15.</note> and yet he plainly tells them, <hi>When you ſpread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; yea, when you make many prayers, I will not hear.</hi> He commanded them to ſacrifice, and yet he ſaith, <hi>To what purpoſe is the multitude of your ſacrifices?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſe 11.</note> and all becauſe they did not manage their prayers, nor ſacrifices, in a right manner; their hands were full of bloud, and their hearts were full of ſins, and their lives were full of lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and therefore all their ſervices were vain oblations, yea, an abomination to God. An unfound heart looks no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to the ſubſtance of the command; if he has heard, and prayed, and faſted, and read, and repeated, and given alms, and received the Lord's Supper, he ſtrokes himſelf, and bleſſes himſelf, and hugs himſelf, and thinks all is well, and ſo he looks no further: But now a ſound ſincere Chriſtian, he looks to the circumſtance as well as the ſubſtance, to the manner as well as to the matter of the command; when he prayes, he labours to pray fervently, earneſtly,<note place="margin">Jam. 5.17, 18.</note> he labours to get his heart into his prayers; when he hears, he will hear with attention and intention of ſpirit; when he walks,<note place="margin">Mich. 6.8. 1 Pet. 2.12. &amp; 3.1, 2, 3. 1 Theſ. 2.10. 2 Cor. 1.12, Pſal. 110.3.</note> he endeavours to walk wiſely, humbly, faithfully, fruitfully, circumſpectly, exemplarily, winningly, convincingly, blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly; when he obeys, he deſires and endeavours to obey freely, willingly, cheerfully. O Sirs! if we pray, and pray not fervently; if we hear, and hear not fruitfully; if we obey, and obey not willingly; if we ſhew mercy,<note place="margin">Iſa. 58.13.</note> and do it not cheerfully; if we ſanctifie the Sabbath, and not with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, all is worth nothing, all will come to nothing. Mark, there are ſome circumſtances acceſſary, ſome neceſſary, ſome wherein the being, and ſome wherein the well being of a duty doth conſiſt; and if you abſtract theſe from them, the duty is worth nothing; take away fervency and humility from prayer, take away faithfulneſs and fruitfulneſs from hearing, and take away willingneſs and delight from obedience, and all will be worth nothing. God regards not only the matter, but the manner. <hi>Criton</hi> the Papiſt could ſay, That God loved better Adverbs than Nouns, not to pray only, but to pray
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:52491:92"/> well; <hi>Non bonum ſed bene agere,</hi> Not to do good, but to do it well, is the great wiſdom of a Chriſtian; what is the Sun without light, or the fountain without water, or the body without the ſoul, or wood without fire, or a bullet without a gun, or a Ship without a rudder? no more are words in prayer, without the ſpirit of prayer. God looks more at the manner, than at the matter of your prayers. And let thus much ſuffice to confirm the firſt particular. But,</p>

               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And the firſt is drawn from the ſupremacy and ſoveraignty of God, who alone is to preſcribe to man his duty; he is our great Lord and Maſter, he is our Lord and Law-giver, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.22. <hi>For the Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the Lord is our King,</hi> James 4.12. <hi>There is one Law-giver, who is able to ſave and to deſtroy; who art thou that judgeſt another?</hi> Now by the Laws of this Lord and Law-giver, we muſt ſquare all our actions. Look, as it would be very abſurd in a ſervant to do that work which he thinks meet, and not what his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:52491:92"/> commands; ſo 'tis as abſurd for men to think, that God will accept of this or that at their hands, when they can't plead his ſuperſcription and authority for what they do. God will one day ſay to ſuch, <hi>Who hath required this at your hands?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 1.12.</note> O Sirs! you muſt lay the command of God as a foundation for what you do, or elſe all your buildings, though never ſo glorious, will certainly totter and fall; in all you do, you muſt be able to ſay, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord;</hi> or elſe after you have done your beſt, you may be undone for ever. But,</p>
               <p>Secondly, God's promiſe and bleſſing is only annexed to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> God's command; he that will have the ſweet of the promiſe, and the bleſſings of heaven, he muſt look that his obedience be bottomed upon divine commands; in holy actions 'tis not thy performance, nor thy grace, nor thy warmth, nor thy zeal, but the command and the promiſe that is annexed to it, that will bear thee out;<note place="margin">Gal. 4.28. Heb. 6.17.</note> therefore we are called children of the promiſe, and heirs of the promiſe. The children of God in all their obedience, ſhould ſtill keep an eye upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, and the promiſe of God, as ever they would run the race that is ſet before them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. But,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Our obedience muſt be grounded and bottomed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> upon a divine command, becauſe of that great corruption, pollution, blindneſs and darkneſs which is upon our minds and underſtandings, which would carry us to what not, if we were not to ſteer our Chriſtian courſe by divine commands.<note place="margin">Col. 2.20, 21, 22.</note> The Apoſtle condemns thoſe things which had a ſhew of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and great mortification, becauſe they were not bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed upon a divine command; and Chriſt condemned ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny practiſes of the Scribes and Phariſees, becauſe they were not bottomed upon a divine command. As you may ſee by comparing the 6, 15. and 23. Chapters of <hi>Matthew</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Our obedience muſt be bottomed upon a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> command, becauſe elſe we can never be able to bear up our hearts comfortably, couragiouſly, confidently and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,

All the Meſſages that the Prophets delivered, were ſtill grounded upon a divine command,<note place="margin">Acts 4.19, 20. &amp; 5.29.</note> 
                  <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord;</hi> and this ſteeled their ſpirits in the work of the Lord, this made them reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and undaunted in the midſt of all the afflictions and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions that they met with: And ſo 'twas a word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that raiſed the ſpirits, and encouraged the hearts of the Apoſtles in the work of the Lord, in the face of all the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, threatnings and buffetings that they met with from the civil powers. You know <hi>Abſalom</hi> layes his bloudy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand upon his ſervants, as their higheſt encouragement to that bloudy work of killing his brother <hi>Amnon,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.28. <hi>Now</hi> Abſalom <hi>had commanded his ſervants,</hi> (his Aſſaſines) <hi>ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Mark ye now when</hi> Amnons <hi>heart is merry with wine, and when I ſay unto you, ſmite</hi> Amnon, <hi>then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be couragious, and be valiant;</hi> or ſons of valour, as the Hebrew runs. And ſo a Chriſtian muſt lay the command of God before him, as his higheſt encouragement to do what God requires of him, &amp;c.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly and laſtly, Our obedience muſt be bottomed and grounded upon the commands of God, to difference and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh our ſelves from all hypocrites, formaliſts, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious and prophane perſons, whoſe obedience is ſometimes bottomed upon the Traditions of men, and ſometimes upon the commandments of men. 'Twas the ſin of the Ten Tribes, that they complyed with the command of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and his Princes,<note place="margin">Iſa. 29.13, 14. Mat. 15.1 to 10. Mark 7.8 to 10.

                  <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.3. <hi>The cuſtoms of the people are vain,</hi> &amp;c. and ſometimes upon the examples of great men. This was that which the Phariſees objected againſt believing on Chriſt;

                  <hi>Have any of the Rulers, or of the Phariſees believed on him? but this people who knoweth not the Law are curſed.</hi> And ſometimes they bottom their obedience upon the example of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. This was <hi>Demetrius</hi> his argument againſt <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 19.26, 27.</note> on the behalf of <hi>Diana,</hi> that all <hi>Aſia</hi> and the world did worſhip her; and therefore the doctrine of <hi>Paul,</hi> that they be no Gods which are made with hands was falfe, and not to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. This hath alwayes been, and is ſtill the common plea of many, We do but as the moſt do; and ſure a great many eyes can ſee more than one or two: And hereupon they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim againſt others for their ſingularity, becauſe they won't do as the reſt of their neighbours do. But,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That obedience that ſprings from faith, is a grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> obedience, 'tis an abounding obedience; ſuch a man's deſires, will, ſtudy and labour, is to get up to the higheſt pitch of obedience, to get up to the higheſt round in <hi>Jacob's</hi> lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.19. <hi>I know thy work, and charity, and ſervice, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the laſt to be more than the firſt.</hi> The Angel of the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi>

This faithful Paſtor is commended for his holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in grace and holineſs. So <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 3.12. <hi>Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect; but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which alſo I am ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended of Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Ver. 13. <hi>Brethren, I count not my ſelf to have apprehended; but this one thing I do, forgetting thoſe things which are behind, and reaching forth unto thoſe things which are before.</hi> Ver. 14. <hi>I preſs towards the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> The Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, doth emphatically import, a preſſing, with an eager purſuit after the mark: It is the ſame word that ſignifies to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, becauſe the earneſtneſs of his ſpirit in preſſing toward the mark, now is the ſame that it was in the perſecution of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:52491:94"/> thoſe that preſſed toward the mark before. Look, as good runners, when they come near unto the mark, ſtretch out their heads, and hands, and whole bodies, to take hold of them that run with them, or of the mark that is before them; ſo he in his whole race ſo laboured unto that which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as if he were ſtill ſtretching out his arms to take hold of it. If ſuch a man might have his choice, he would be the moſt humble, the moſt holy, the moſt heavenly, the moſt mortified, the moſt patient, the moſt contented, the moſt thankful, the moſt fruitful, the moſt active, the moſt zealous, and the moſt ſelf-denying Chriſtian in the world;<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.15, 16. Mat. 5.</note> if he might have his choice, he would be holy as God is holy, and perfect as his heavenly father is perfect; he would do the will of God on earth, as thoſe Princes of glory, the Angels, do it now in heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> freely, readily, cheerfully, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfully, univerſally, reverentially, and unweariedly, &amp;c. if he might have his choice,<note place="margin">Eccl. 9.10.</note> he would exerciſe every grace, and perform every duty, with all his might; he ſees ſo much excellency and beauty in God and Chriſt, that he can't be at reſt till he be ſwallowed up in the enjoyment of them; he ſees ſo much excellency in grace, that nothing but perfection of grace will ſatisfie him; he makes perfection not only his utmoſt end, but he alſo labours after perfection with his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſtrength and endeavours. When God is made the one of a mans deſires, the one of a mans affections, the one of a mans life and comfort, then will he be the one of a mans en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours too. That obedience that ſprings from faith (when 'tis not winter-time with a Chriſtian) is a fruitful obedience, 'tis an abounding obedience, 'tis a progreſſive obedience. Look, as the mercy and favour of God to a believer, is not ſtinted nor limited, ſo the obedience of a believer to God is not ſtinted or limited; but now the obedience of hypocrites is alwayes ſtinted and limited; this command they will obey, but not that; this duty they will do, but not that; this work they will attend, but not that, &amp;c.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, That obedience that ſprings from faith, is the obedience of a ſon, not of a ſlave; 'tis a free voluntary evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical

True obedience flows from principles of heartineſs and love within, and not from by and baſe reſpects and ends, that are carnal and worldly. It is obſervable, that <hi>John</hi>'s obedience was as ample and as large as God's command, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10.30. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto</hi> Jehu, <hi>becauſe thou haſt done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes, and haſt

And yet becauſe his heart was not in his obedience, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did not purely act for God, but for himſelf, that he might bring about his own deſigns, he met with a revenge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a reward; as you may ſee in that, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.4. <hi>And the Lord, ſaid unto him, call his name</hi> Jezreel, <hi>for yet a little while, and I will avenge the bloud of</hi> Jezreel <hi>upon the houſe of</hi> Jehu. <hi>Jehu's</hi> heart was not in his obedience, he had a diſpenſatory conſcience; for though he rooted out <hi>Baals</hi> worſhip, yet the golden Calves muſt ſtill continue: He deſtroyed Idolaters, but not Idolatry; and this carnal policy brought down ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance and miſery upon him and his poſterity. <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> goes far, <hi>Ezra</hi> 7.23. <hi>Whatſoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done.</hi> To what a highth doth this Heathen Prince riſe? He will do anything for God, he will do every thing for God that he requires. But mark, what is that which moves him to it? Is it love to God? is it delight in God?

O, but now a true child of God, he has the Law of God writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, not only in his underſtanding, but alſo in his heart and affections; and this is that which makes his obedience to be pleaſing and delightful to him; ſo that if he might be free from the injunctions and directions of the Word (with the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant

Look, as the eye delights in ſeeing, and the ear in hearing, ſo a gracious heart (except when 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a cloud of diſſertion, or in the School of temptation, or under ſome grievous tormenting afflictions, or ſadly worſted by ſome prevalent corruption) delights in obeying: Actions of nature, you know, are actions of delight; and ſo are all thoſe actions that ſpring from a new nature, a divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp;c.</p>

To make this a little more clearly and fully out, obſerve with me theſe few things. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, No contrary commands of men, ſhall take this man off from his obedience to the commands of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.19. Chap. 5.29. &amp;c. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, No ſtream of evil examples, no current of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt times, ſhall bear them down in wayes of obedience, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.15. <hi>I and my houſhold will ſerve the Lord, though all</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhould ſerve Idols.</hi> And <hi>Noah</hi> was upright with God, and walked with God in his generation, when the whole world was overſpread with violence, and all fleſh had cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted their wayes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.9.

               <p>Thirdly, No worldly profit or advantage ſhall bribe this man from his obedience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.8. <hi>Abraham</hi> will obey and follow God, though he forſakes all the benefits and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his native Countrey, and of his Father's houſe, not knowing where his lot ſhould fall, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Fifthly, No floud of natural affection ſhall hinder them in the way of their obedience.

               <p>Phyſicians obſerve a difference 'twixt the natural and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-natural heat in mens bodies; the preter-natural heat, which ariſeth from diſtemper, may be more for the preſent, but as it exceeds for meaſure, ſo it abates for time, becauſe the natural heat is a more equal and moderate, and durable heat, every part hath an equal ſhare, and it is not extream, and yet it continues. Thus it is with Hypocrites and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right perſons in the matter of obedience.

               <p>But now mark, that obedience that ſprings from Faith, that is a conſtant obedience, that is conſtant in oppoſition to fits and ſtarts, and imports the courſe and bent of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> The ninth and laſt (though not the leaſt end) is the honour and glory of the great God. God's grace is the ſpring, and God's glory is the end of all a Chriſtians obedience; God's glory is the ultimate end,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.7, 8. Phil. 1.20, 21.</note> the primary end, the univerſal end, the Sea to which all a Chriſtians actions, like ſo many Rivers, move and bend: 'Tis true, many poor, low, mean, baſe ends, may creep into a Chriſtians performances; but here mark, 1. They are diſallowed. 2. They are loathed and abhorred. 3. They are reſiſted and ſtriven againſt. 4. They are lamented and mourned over. 5. The gracious ſoul would willingly be rid of them; if a Chriſtian might have his choice, he would never be troubled with any baſe end any more. Beloved, you muſt alwayes diſtinguiſh between a mans ſetled and his ſuggeſted ends; a mans ſetled end may be one things, and his ſuggeſted end another thing. Now for ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this; That the great God alwayes makes a judgement

It is in this caſe, as it may be with a man that ſhoots at a mark, he aims aright at the mark, but his elbow may meet with a jog, which may carry the arrow quite another way than what he intended; or as it is with a man that is ſailing to ſuch a Haven, or to ſuch a Harbour, he ſteers a right courſe by his Compaſs, but the winds blowing contrary, and the Sea running high, he is forced into ſuch a creek, or ſuch a Harbour, which he never intended, &amp;c.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
                  </label> You muſt diſtinguiſh between an actual aim and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> intention, and an habitual aim and intention. For the firſt, an actual aim and intention of the Spirit, in every particular action that a man doth to the glory of God, is utterly impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, whilſt we carry about us with a body of ſin and death: The Angels and ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, do thus actually aim at the glory of God in all they do; but 'tis a work that will be too high and too hard for us, whilſt we are here in a polluted eſtate. This was ſo high a mark, that <hi>Adam</hi> miſt it in his innocency; no wonder then if we often miſs it in our ſinful ſtate and condition. But,</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is an habitual inclination in us in every <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> action we do, to aim at the honour and glory of God, though there be not the actual intention of the ſpirit in every action we do; it is with us, as with a man travelling towards a Town or City, he thinks in the morning to go to ſuch a Town, ſuch a place, where he purpoſes to lye the firſt night, and therefore ſets forth towards it; and though he doth not think of this every ſtep he takes, yet it's his purpoſe in his journey, to reſt there at night; or as it is with a man that comes to Church, his end is to hear the Word of the Lord; yet in every word he hears ſpoken, he hath not the thought
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:52491:101"/> of his end upon his ſpirit, but he is there by vertue of his firſt intention: So here, though in every particular there be not an intention of ſpirit to level this or that action to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, yet it is the main drift and habitual ſcope of a mans ſpirit, that Gods glory may be the end of all his actions.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, There is a mediate, and there is an immediate eying or looking to the glory of God; as when I forbear ſuch or ſuch a ſin, becauſe God by ſuch a command hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden it, or I do ſuch or ſuch a duty, becauſe God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it. Now, in eying of the command of God, I eye the glory of God immediately, though not mediately. But,</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, In ſome particular or ſpecial caſes, I ought actually to eye the glory of God: As, 1. In ſome eminent or extraordinary ſervice that I am to do for Chriſt. Or, 2. In ſome ſpecial teſtimony that I am call'd to give for Chriſt or his Goſpel. Or, 3. In ſome great thing that I am call'd to ſuffer for Chriſt, or his Goſpel, or his intereſt. But,</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, The more a Chriſtian actually eyes the glory of God in all he does, the more, 1. He glorifies God. 2. The neerer you are the life of heaven, and the more you act like the glorious Angels, and the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect. 3. The more will be your joy, comfort and peace, both in life and death, and in the day of your account. 4. The more ſtrong will be your confidence and aſſurance, that your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual eſtate is good, and that you ſhall be ſaved for ever. 5. The better you will be able to bear up under all the falſe, hard, and ſowre cenſures of this world. 6. The more you will be temptation proof. 7. The more glorious and weighty will be your crown of glory at laſt; he ſhall be higheſt in heaven, who has actually aimed moſt at the glory of God in this lower world. And thus you ſee how you may know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your obedience is ſuch an obedience as ſprings from faith, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> Now, if upon trial you ſhall find, that your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is the obedience of faith, then you may ſafely and groundedly conclude, that you have a ſaving work of God upon your hearts. But,</p>

               <p>Fourthly, A gracious heart is an uniform heart. Ubiquity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> is a ſure evidence of integrity. He that is truly good, will be good in bad times, and in the worſt of places;<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.112. 1 John 3.9.

A gracious ſoul will be ſteddy and fixed in his principles, in the worſt times, in the worſt places, and under variety of diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; let times and places be what they will, he will not diſhonour his God, nor blemiſh his profeſſion, nor wound his conſcience to preſerve his ſafety, or to ſecure his liberty.

O Sirs! look as no man can ſincerely ſeek God in vain, ſo no man can ſincerely deſire grace in vain. A man may love gold, yet not have it; but no man loveth God, but is ſure to have him. Wealth a man may deſire, and yet be never the neerer for it; but grace no man ever ſincerely deſired and miſſed it: And why? it is God that hath wrought this deſire in the heart, and he will never fruſtrate the deſire that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath there wrought; let no man ſay, I have no faith, no repentance, no love, no fear of God, no ſanctifying, no ſaving grace in me. Doth he ſee a want of thoſe things in himſelf? yes, that is it which ſo grieves him, that he cannot love God, ſtand in awe of him, truſt in his mercy, repent of ſin as he ſhould; yea, but doth he ſeriouſly and unfeignedly deſire to do thus? yes, he deſires it above all things in the world, and would be willing (as it were) to buy even with a whole world the leaſt meaſure, or dram, or drop only of ſuch grace. Now let me ask him, who is it that hath wrought this deſire in him? Not the Devil, for he would rather quench it than kindle it in him; not his own corruption, for that is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally averſe to every thing that is good, it muſt needs then be the work of the Spirit of God, who works in us both to will and to do of his own good pleaſure, and who pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth all them bleſſed that thus deſire after grace.<note place="margin">Kemnitius, Urſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni Catechis.</note> When I have a good deſire, ſaith one, though it doth ſcarcely ſhew it ſelf in ſome little ſlender ſigh, I muſt be aſſured that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God is preſent, and worketh his good work.

Then thoſe holy deſires and prayers being the motions of the holy Ghoſt in us, are teſtimonies of our faith, although they ſeem to us ſmall and weak.

Grace puts a man to take up the Croſs of Chriſt, to deny his natural ſelf, his ſinful ſelf, his religious ſelf, his relative ſelf, and to give up a mans ſelf to the ſtricteſt and exacteſt wayes of God, and to crucifie his luſts, and to pull out his right eye, and to cut off his right hand, &amp;c.

Certainly, wherever there are true ſerious deſires after grace, there is a dear love to thoſe upon whoſe hearts the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:52491:109" rendition="simple:additions"/> work of grace is paſt. Now by theſe ſhort hints, 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent enough, that wicked men don't, nor can't ſincerely, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly deſire grace; certainly ſuch that are poor in ſpirit, and that mourn for their ſpiritual defects, and that hunger and thirſt after grace and holineſs, after a righteouſneſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted and a righteouſneſs imputed, muſt confeſs themſelves to be in a bleſſed eſtate, and conſequently in a ſtate of grace; (for what true happineſs is there out of it?) or elſe they muſt contradict our Saviour, and charge truth it ſelf with untruth, who hath pronounced them bleſſed that are ſo qualified, ſo affected. Were this well weighed and ſeriouſly conſidered of, how would it comfort, refreſh, ſupport and ſtay up many a troubled ſoul? and what a well-ſpring of life would this be to many a wounded ſpirit? Doubtleſs the greateſt part of a Saints perfection in this life (witneſs <hi>Pauls</hi> own ingenious confeſſion after fourteen years converſion,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.15, 18, 19, 21, 22.</note> ſay ſome; and who ever went beyond him? and how exceedingly do moſt fall ſhort of him?) conſiſteth rather in will than in work, and in deſire and endeavour more than in deed. There is ſo much good in good deſires, that it is the main that the godly have to ſpeak of, and to reckon of; make an inventory of a Chriſtians eſtate, and ſearch every room, if you find not theſe you find nothing; and if you ſet theſe down in the inventory, you ſet down even all he is worth for another world. <hi>Daniel</hi> is called a man of deſires, and ſo is every gracious man, a man wholly made up of gracious deſires.<note place="margin">Dan. 10 11.</note> Mark, God makes a judgment upon the ſons of men, according as their deſires ſtand; he that deſires to ſteal, he is a Thief in the account of God; and he that deſires to commit adultery, he is an adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer in the account of God; and he that deſires to oppreſs, he is an oppreſſor in the account of God; and he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to deceive, he is a deceiver in the account of God; and he that deſires to perſecute, he is a perſecutor in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of God; and he that deſires to prophane the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths of God, he is a prophaner of the Sabbaths of God in the account of God, &amp;c.

The Kings daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is all glorious within, though within is not all her glory; grace differs nothing from glory but in name, grace is glory in the bud, and glory is grace at the full; grace is glory mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant, and glory is grace triumphant; grace has an inward glory upon it, which none can ſee and love, but ſuch as have grace in their own hearts: Wicked men can ſee no beauty, no glory, no excellency in grace, why they ſhould deſire it, or be taken with it;<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.1, 2, 3, 4.</note> and no wonder, for they could ſee no beauty, nor excellency, nor glory, nor form, nor comelineſs in Chriſt the fountain of grace, why they ſhould deſire him, and be taken with him. Though next to Chriſt grace is the moſt lovely and deſirable thing in all the world, yet none can deſire it for its own lovelineſs and deſirableneſs, but ſuch as have a ſeed of God in them; though grace be a pearl of price, though it be a jewel more worth than the gold of <hi>Ophir,</hi> though it be a beam of God, a ſpark of glory, a branch of the divine nature; yet carnal hearts can ſee no glory nor excellency in it, that they ſhould deſire it.

According to the Hebrew the words may be read thus; The memory of the juſt ſhall be for a bleſſing; the very remembring of the juſt ſhall bring a bleſſing upon them that remember them. When a gracious man dies, as he carries a good conſcience with him, ſo he leaves a perfumed name behind him. Grace is the image of God, the delight of God, the honour of God, the glory of God; grace is the purchaſe of Chriſt, and the birth of the Spirit, and the pledge of glory; grace is the joy of Angels, the glory of man, and the wonder of the world; what's the body without the ſoul? what's the cabinet without the jewels? what's the Sun without light? what's the fountain without water? what's Paradiſe without the Tree of Life? what's Heaven without Chriſt? That's a ſoul without grace. Now every gracious ſoul ſees a real, internal excellency, beauty and glory in grace, and accordingly it is carried out in its deſires after it; it ſees ſuch an innate excellency, beauty and glory in that faith, wiſdom, humility, meekneſs, patience, zeal, ſelf-denial, heavenly-mindedneſs, uprightneſs, &amp;c. that ſparkles and ſhines in ſuch and ſuch Saints, that it many times

O, that my ſoul was but in their caſe! I don't covet their riches but their graces: Oh, that I had but thoſe graces!

               <p>Eighthly, No man can ſincerely deſire all grace, every <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> grace, or the whole chain of graces, but he that has true grace.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</note> Vain men, when they are under ſome outward or inward diſtreſſes, may to ſerve their preſent turns, deſire (in a cold, formal, cuſtomary way) patience, or contentation, or meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or hope, or faith, &amp;c. but they don't, nor can't, whilſt they are wicked, whilſt they are in their natural eſtate,<note place="margin">Act. 8.19. to 25.</note> whilſt they are in the gall of bitterneſs and bond of iniquity, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely deſire every grace, eſpecially thoſe particular graces that are moſt oppoſite to their maſter ſin, to their darling luſts, to their conſtitution ſins, to their complexion ſins, to thoſe particular luſts that are to them as dear as their right eyes or right hands. <hi>Auſtin</hi> before his converſion, he was much given to whoredom, and he would often pray, Lord, give me continency, but not yet; Lord, give me continency, but not yet; he was afraid leſt God ſhould have heard him to ſoon, as himſelf confeſſeth. Wicked men would be very ſorry if God ſhould take them at their words, and in good earneſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the cold and lazy deſires of their ſouls: If when the drunkard in a good mood ſhould deſire ſobriety, God ſhould take him at his word, he would be very angry; or if when the unclean perſon ſhould deſire chaſtity, continency, God

The ſame may be ſaid of all other ſorts of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; but now a real Chriſtian, though he be never ſo weak, yet he ſeriouſly deſires every grace, he is for every link of the golden chain of graces, he finds in his own heart, ſins that are contrary to every grace, and therefore he deſires every grace, that he may make head againſt every ſin; and he finds his heart and life ſo attended and ſurrounded with all ſorts and kinds of temptations, that he earneſtly, ſeriouſly, and frequently deſires the preſence and aſſiſtance of every grace, that ſo he may be temptation-proof, yea, victorious over every temptation; and he ſees and feels the need of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very grace, to fill up every place, ſtation and condition wherein the Lord has ſet him, and therefore he begs hard for every grace; and he ſees a beauty, and a glory, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency upon every grace, and therfore he deſires every grace as well as any one ſingle grace, which no hypocrite or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane perſon in the world does.

Now, every weak be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is able to appeal to God, that he deſires grace for gracious ends and purpoſes, as for the ends laſt cited, and others of the like nature with them. Wicked men may in a fit deſire grace,<note place="margin">Act. 8.18, 19, 20.</note> as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> did deſire the holy Ghoſt to get money by it, or when they are under ſome pangs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, they may deſire grace to be rid of their horrors and terrors, or when they are upon a dying bed they may deſire ſo much grace as may keep them out of hell, and bring them to heaven; but in all this they look no further than ſelf, they are far from deſiring of grace for gracious ends and purpoſes.

Luke 17.5.</note> the weakeſt Chriſtian has his eye to the higheſt round in <hi>Jacob</hi>'s ladder, and fain he would be at the top of it; and Oh, how ſweet is every Providence, and every Ordinance, and every duty, and every mercy, and every opportunity, that helps his ſoul more Chriſt-wards, and heaven-wards, and holineſs-wards! ſincere deſires, and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous endeavours to grow in grace,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.18. 1 Pet. 2.2. 1 Joh. 5.13. 1 Joh. 3.9.</note> is an infallible evidence of the truth of grace. Look, as a man may have grace and not know it, ſo a man may grow in grace and yet not diſcern it. As in the lopping of a Tree there ſeems to be a kind of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution and deſtruction, yet the end and iſſue of it is better growth; and as the weakning of the body by Phyſick ſeems to tend to death, yet it produceth better health and more ſtrength; and as the Ball by falling downward riſeth upward, and water in pipes deſcends that it may aſcend, ſo the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſpiritual growth, when ſeemingly dead and declining, and to ſtand at a ſtay, is ſtill carried on by the hidden method of God to encreaſe; for every true Chriſtian is a member of a thriving body, in which there is no Atrophy, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual iſſuing of ſpirits from the head;<note place="margin">The righteous ſhall flouriſh like the Palm tree, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.12, 13, 14. The Palm tree never loſeth his leaf or fruit, <hi>Pliny.</hi> Grace grows not alike in all Saints; in the parable, ſome brought forth thirty, ſome ſixty, and ſome a hundred fold.</note> ſo that life being wrought by the ſpirit of life never dyeth, but is alwayes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the growing hand (except in the dark winter night of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion and temptations) ripening and encreaſing even in the midſt of all ordinary troubles and trials. The Apoſtle tells us, that the whole body of Chriſt (whereof every true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is a limb) is ſo compact together in it ſelf, and ſo firmly faſtned with certain ſpiritual nerves and ligaments to the head, that from it there is by them conveyed to each part a continual ſupply of ſpiritual grace, both ſufficient to furniſh it, and to further the growth of it. Let me give a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther light into this particular, by this ſimilitude: A man is bound for the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and ſhapeth his courſe thitherward, but by the way is put often off by croſs winds to the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:52491:113"/> he is by contrary winds compelled to put into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Harbours, and to make ſome ſtay by the way there, either to ſhift off ſtormy weather, or to take in freſh water, or to ſtop a leak, or to get ſome freſh proviſions; and yet all this while we truly ſay, he is going on in his way in his voyage, becauſe his ſetled purpoſe and conſtant reſolution is to make to his Port, his Haven whither he is bound, and all theſe ſeeming lets ſhall help forward his voyage. It is ſo in ſpiritual things, for our very growth in grace conſiſts much in ſincere deſires, in fixed reſolutions, and in faithful endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to grow in grace.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> makes it the mark of a good man, that he ſtudieth how he may grow better than he is, not contenting himſelf with any degree or meaſure of goodneſs. And another Heathen obſerves, that the earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of what men would have, maketh them forgetful of what they have. I forget what's paſt (ſaith the Apoſtle) and preſs on to what is before. Their eye is more upon what they want, than upon what they have. It is with good Chriſtians in this caſe, as it is with rich worldlings; that like men in a race, have their eye on thoſe that be before them, not on thoſe that come after them, they are ever eying thoſe that ſeem to out-ſtrip and out-go them in wealth, and think they have nothing, and that they are but poor men, ſo long as they come ſhort of ſuch and ſuch, who are rich and great in the world: And ſo it is with many precious Chriſtians, they have ſtill their eye fixt upon thoſe whoſe examples they either read of, or whoſe courſes and graces they are eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſes of; and hereupon they think that they have no grace, or elſe that they make no progreſs in grace, at leaſt worth ſpeaking of, ſo long as they come behind and fall ſhort of ſuch and ſuch, who are very eminent, or moſt eminent in grace and holineſs; and upon this account it is, that they make ſuch ſore complaints of their ſpiritual wants, and of their ſlow progreſs in grace and holineſs, and that they can hardly perceive but that they ſtand ſtill at a ſtay. Now mark, theſe ſad complaints of theirs, and their ſerious deſires to grow in grace, is a ſure and infallible evidence of the truth of grace in them; yea it is a ſure argument that they love
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:52491:114"/> grace as it is grace, that they love grace for grace ſake, which none can do but ſuch as have grace. 'Tis a ſure ſign that he was never truly good, that deſireth not to be better <hi>(ille non eſt bonus qui non vult eſſe melior)</hi> yea, he has very great cauſe to fear, that his heart is naught, very naught, if not ſtark naught, that deſireth not to be as good as the beſt, to be as gracious as he that is moſt gracious, and to be as holy as he that is moſt holy.

               <p>Eleventhly, No man can alwayes deſire grace, but he that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> has true grace, conſtant deſires after grace, argues the reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of grace;<note place="margin">Iſa. 26.7, 8, 9.

O, what ſhall we do for grace!

But all theſe deſires of theirs are but like the morning cloud, or the early dew that quickly paſſeth away: But now if you look upon the weak Chriſtian, as you ſhall commonly find a tear in his eye, a ſigh in his breaſt, and a complaint in

O, when ſhall I have more of theſe! O, that God would cut me ſhort in any thing, yea in every thing, rather than cut me ſhort in theſe things, that the deſires of my ſoul are ſo much running after! Theſe deſires of theirs may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ſet forth by a ſpring between a couple of hills; the ſpring will alwayes run through thoſe lets that ſtop it, or elſe it will run over thoſe lets, for it cannot ceaſe running if it be a living ſpring; ſo the deſires of a gracious ſoul will ſtill be running after God, and Chriſt, and grace, &amp;c. The good deſires of bad men after God, and Chriſt, and grace, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, are like water in a Ciſtern, that quickly runs out; but the deſires of a godly man after God, Chriſt, grace, holineſs, are like water in a fountain that is ſtill a running. An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound Chriſtian is never good at all times, he is only good by fits, and ſtarts, and turns ſometimes when he is Sermon-ſick, or under a ſmarting rod, or a gauled conſcience, or when he is under ſome heavy croſs, or ſad loſs; O, then he will be good! O, then he will have God, and he will have Chriſt, and he will have grace, and he will have heaven; but this good frame, this good temper of his is not laſting, 'tis not abiding, 'tis like a vapour that quickly vaniſhes, or like a wind-mill that goes as long as the wind fills the ſails, but no longer. Theſe are like <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> the Emperor, who when he was ſick, would be very godly; but when he was well, none more wicked. But,</p>
               <p>Twelfthly, No man can ſincerely deſire to abound and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> excel moſt in thoſe particular graces which are moſt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and contrary to thoſe particular ſins which his natural temper, conſtitution, complexion, calling, or condition,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:52491:115"/> does moſt expoſe him and incline him to, but he that has true grace, but he whoſe heart is ſincere with God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.23. <hi>I was upright before him, and I kept my ſelf from mine iniquity.</hi> If paſſion be a ſincere Chriſtians head-luſt, then his deſires run moſt out for meekneſs; if pride, then his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires are moſt for humility; if earthlineſs, then his deſires are moſt for heavenly-mindedneſs; if unbelief, then his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,<note place="margin">Luke 17.5.</note> are moſt for faith; you ſhall then find him with the Diſciples, crying out, <hi>Lord, increaſe our faith.</hi> But now, though a wicked mans heart riſe againſt every grace, yet it riſes moſt ſtrongly againſt thoſe particular graces which are moſt oppoſite and contrary to thoſe particular luſts which are a wicked mans boſom luſts,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.8, 9.</note> his darling ſins, &amp;c.

But now it is quite otherwiſe with a true child of God,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.22, 23.</note> for his heart riſes and ſwells moſt againſt the Toad or Toads that are in his own boſom; and the daily and earneſt deſires of his ſoul are, that God would make him eminent in every grace, yea that God would make him moſt eminent in thoſe particular graces which are moſt oppoſite and contrary to thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular luſts and corruptions which more peculiarly, more eſpecially he hath cauſe to call his iniquity,<note place="margin">Pſal. 49.5.</note> or the iniquities of his heart, and of his heels.

               <p>Thirteenthly, No man can truly love grace in another, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> he that has true grace in his own ſoul.<note place="margin">1 John 3.10.</note> No man can love a Saint as a Saint, but he that is a real Saint; no man can love holineſs in another, but he that has holineſs in his own ſoul; no man can love a good man for goodneſs ſake, but he that is really good; <hi>We know that we have paſſed from death to life,</hi>

He that loves his brother (ſaith <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) better knows his love wherewith he loves, than his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> brother whom he loves.</note> that there are no men in all the world that are ſo precious, ſo lovely, ſo comely, ſo excellent, and ſo honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in his account, in his eye, as thoſe that have the Image of God, of Chriſt, of grace, of holineſs moſt clearly, moſt fairly, and moſt fully ſtampt upon them. When a poor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian can rejoyce in every light, in every Sun that out-ſhines his own; when he ſees wiſdom and knowledge ſhining in one Saint, and faith and love ſhining in another Saint, and humility and lowlineſs ſhining in another Saint, and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and uprightneſs ſhining in another Saint, and zeal and courage ſhining in another Saint, and patience and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy ſhining in another, and then can make his retreat to his cloſet, admiring &amp; bleſſing of the Lord for the various gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Spirit ſhining in his children, and be frequent and earneſt with God, that thoſe very graces might ſhine as ſo many Suns in his ſoul; doubtleſs ſuch a poor ſoul has true grace, and is happy, and will be happy to all eternity. In <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian's</hi> time, the Heathen would point out the Chriſtians by
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:52491:116"/> this mark, <hi>See how they love one another.</hi> Now to prevent mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, I ſhall ſhew you the ſeveral properties of ſincere love to the Saints.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, True love to the Saints is ſpiritual, it is a love for the Image of God that is ſtampt upon the ſoul, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.1. <hi>Every one that loveth him that begat,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 John 4.7.</note> 
                  <hi>loveth him alſo that is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of him.</hi> A ſoul that truly loves, loves the father for his own ſake, and the children for the fathers ſake. If the Image of God be the load-ſtone that drawes out our love to the Saints, then our love is real to them; he that does not love the Saints as Saints, he that does not love them under a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual notion he hath no true affection to them. Naturally we hate God,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.15. 1 John 3.12.</note> becauſe he is a holy God, and his Law becauſe it is an holy Law, and his people becauſe they are a holy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. 'Tis only the Spirit of God that can inable a man to love a Saint for the image of God that is in him; many there are which love Chriſtians for their goods, not for their good; they love them for the money that is in their purſes, but not for the grace that is in their hearts; many like the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Cur, fawn upon a good ſuit. Love to the Saints for the Image of God ſtampt upon them, is a flower that does not grow in natures garden. No man can love grace in another mans heart, but he that hath grace in his own; men do not more naturally love their parents,<note place="margin">Prov. 29.10. Ezek. 25.15.</note> and love their children, and love themſelves, than they do naturally hate the image of God upon his people and wayes. I have read of one who was ſo luſty and quarrelſom, that he was ready to fight with his own image ſo often as he ſaw it in a glaſs. O! how many are there in theſe dayes, that are ſtill a quarrelling and fighting with the image of God wherever they ſee it? True love is for what of the divine nature, for what of Chriſt and grace ſhines in a man; it is one thing to love a godly man, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to love him for godlineſs: Many love godly men as they are Politicians, or Potent, or Learned, or of a ſweet nature, or affable, or related, or as they have been kind to them; but all this is but natural love, but to love them becauſe they are ſpiritually lovely, becauſe of the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:52491:116"/> ſeed of God in them, becauſe they are all glorious within,<note place="margin">John 1.3.9. Pſal. 45.13.</note> is to love them as becometh Saints, it is to love them at a higher and nobler rate, than any hypocrite in the world can reach too. The Waſps flie about the Tradeſman's ſhop, not out of love to him, but the honey and fruit that is there. But,</p>
               <p>Secondly, True love to the Saints is appretiating; a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſoul ſets the higheſt price, and the greateſt value and eſteem upon thoſe that are gracious, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.4. He honours them that fear the Lord;<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.119. Pſal. 1.4.</note> he looks upon the wicked as lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but upon the Saints as jewels; he looks upon the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as droſs, but upon the Saints as the gold of <hi>Ophir;</hi> he looks upon the wicked as chaff, but upon the Saints as wheat;<note place="margin">1 John 12.</note> he looks upon the Saints as ſons, but upon the wicked as ſlaves;<note place="margin">Heb. 1. <hi>ult.</hi>
                  </note> he looks upon the Saints as heirs of ſalvation, but upon the wicked as heirs of damnation. Gracious ſouls do not value perſons by their great Places, Offices, Names, Profeſſions, Arts, Parts, Gifts, gay Cloaths, gold Chains, Honours, Riches, but by what they are worth for another world. As the great God, ſo gracious ſouls look not how rational men are, but how religious; not how great, but how gracious; not how high, but how holy,<note place="margin">Pſal. 16.3.</note> and accordingly they value them. <hi>My goodneſs extends not to thee, but to the Saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent in whom is all my delight.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 12.26.</note> 
                  <hi>The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour.</hi> 'Tis grace that differences one man from another, &amp; that exalts one man above another. A gracious man, though never ſo poor, and low, and contemptible in the world, is a better man than his wicked neighbour (though he be never ſo great or rich in the world) in the eye, account, and eſteem of God, Angels and Saints, there is no man to the gracious man: The Sun doth not more excel and out-ſhine the Stars, than a righteous man doth excel and out-ſhine his unrighteous neighbour.<note place="margin">Prov. 28.6.</note> 
                  <hi>Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightneſs, than he that is perverſe in his wayes, though he be rich.</hi> A gracious man prefers a holy <hi>Job</hi> upon the dunghil, before a wicked <hi>Ahab</hi> upon the Throne: he ſets a higher price upon a gracious <hi>Lazarus,</hi> though
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:52491:117"/> cloathed with rags and full of ſores,<note place="margin">Luke 16.</note> than upon a rich and wretched <hi>Dives,</hi> though he be cloathed gloriouſly, and fares ſumptiouſly every day. This is, and this muſt be for a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,<note place="margin">Pſal. 45.13. Wicked men may highly prize and admire a the common gifts of the Saints, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> admired at the wiſdom of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired at the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Daniel;</hi> but they never prize nor admire at their graces. Every one that doth evil, hateth the light, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.20.</note> that this poor, blind, mad, beſotted world rates and values men according to their worldly intereſt, greatneſs, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and grandure; but gracious ſouls, they rate and value men by their graces, by their inward excellencies, and by what they are worth for eternity; in the eye of a gracious man; there is no wife to a gracious wife, no child to a gracious child, no friend to a gracious friend, no neighbour to a gracious neighbour, no Magiſtrate to a gracious Magiſtrate, no Miniſter to a gracious Miniſter, no Maſter to a gracious Maſter, nor no ſervant to a gracious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; internal excellencies carries it with a gracious man, before all external glories. The <hi>Jews</hi> ſay, that thoſe ſeventy ſouls that went with <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> were as much worth as all the ſeventy Nations in the world: Doubtleſs, ſeventy gracious perſons in the eſteem and judgment of thoſe that are gracious, are more worth than a whole world, yea than ſeventy worlds of graceleſs perſons. Well Sirs, remember this; No man can truly prize, and highly value grace in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but he that hath grace in his own heart. Some prize Chriſtians for their wit, others prize them for their wealth; ſome prize them for their birth and breeding, others prize them for their beauty and worldly glory; ſome prize them for the great things that have been done by them, others prize them for the good things that they have received from them; ſome prize them for their Eagles eyes, others prize them for their ſilver tongues, and others prize them for their golden parts; but he that is truly gracious, he prizes them for the grace of God that is in them, he ſets the higheſt value upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> them for their holineſs,<note place="margin">No unregenerate perſon hath a love to all the Saints; for though he ſeems to love ſome, yet he loaths others; he is guilty of ſinful partiality, having the faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. They ſeem to love the rich, and deſpiſe the poor, <hi>James</hi> 2.</note> &amp;c. But,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, True love to the Saints is univerſal to one Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian as well as another, to all as well as any, to poor <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> as well as to rich <hi>Alraham,</hi> to a deſpiſed <hi>Job</hi> as well as to an admired <hi>David,</hi> to an afflicted <hi>Joſeph</hi> as well as to a raiſed <hi>Iacob,</hi> to a deſpiſed Diſciple as well as to an exalted

                  <hi>Ver.</hi> 5. <hi>Hearken my beloved brethren, hath not God choſen the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the Kingdom?</hi> It is a vile thing, ſaith one of the Ancients, to have the faith of Chriſt in reſpect of perſons. We do not judge of faith by perſons, but of perſons by faith. 'Tis the great wiſdom of a Chriſtian, not to judge of men by their outwards, but by their inwards; not by their externals, but by their internals; not by what they are worth for this world, but by what they are worth for that other world. The poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Saints are God's portion, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.9. They are his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant portion, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.10.

'Tis not race, nor place, but grace that makes a man truly noble; without a peradventure, he that loves one Saint for the image of God that is upon him, he cannot but fall in love with every Saint that bears the lovely image of the Father upon him; he cannot but love a Saint in rags as well as a Saint in robes, a Saint upon the dunghil as well as a Saint upon the throne; uſually thoſe Chriſtians that have leaſt of the world, have moſt of Chriſt; commonly thoſe Chriſtians that have leaſt of the world, have moſt of heaven in their hearts, houſes and lives. But,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, True love to the Saints will extend to thoſe that are moſt remote in reſpect of place,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.26.</note> as well as to thoſe that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> are near. They of <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Achaia</hi> made a contribution for the poor Saints at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3 John 5.</note> The Saints of <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Achaia</hi> did freely and cheerfully contribute to the poor Saints at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whoſe faces probably they had never ſeen. And <hi>Gaius</hi> is commended for his love to ſtrangers. A graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man that has an eſtate, a treaſury, an inheritance, he is like a common fountain that freely gives out to ſtrangers as well as to near neighbors. A great fire will warm thoſe that ſit far from it, as wel as thoſe that ſit neer unto it: So ſincere love will extend and ſtretch out it ſelf to thoſe Saints that are moſt remote; gracious ſouls do dearly love and highly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:52491:119"/> thoſe Saints whoſe faces they have never ſeen, nor are like to ſee in this world, and from whoſe hands they have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the leaſt civility; and all upon the ſerious reports that they have had of the grace of God that has been ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ſhining in them,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.9. 1 Pet. 1.22. 1 John 3.18.</note> whoſe habitations are at a great diſtance from them.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, Our love to the Saints is right, when we love them beſt, and moſt in whom the ſpiritual and ſupernatural cauſes of love are moſt ſparkling and ſhining; where grace draws the affections, there the more grace we ſee, the more we ſhall love, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.3. <hi>My goodneſs extendeth not to thee, but to the Saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 45.19.</note> There are Saints, and there are excellent Saints.

O Sirs! there are ſome Saints that are magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in grace, noble in grace, glorious in grace, wonderful in grace. Now this is certain, if grace be the true reaſon why we love any, then the more excellent, the more magnificent any are in grace,<note place="margin">Pſal. 15.4.</note> the more highly we ſhall prize them, and the more dearly we ſhall love them, and the more abundantly in our hearts we ſhall honour them. Look, as grace riſes higher and higher in the ſame perſon, ſo we ſhall riſe higher and higher in our love to the ſame perſon;<note place="margin">Dan. 9.23. John 21.20.</note> 
                  <hi>Daniel</hi> was greatly beloved, and <hi>Iohn</hi> was ſingularly beloved; and why? but becauſe they were more eminently gracious than others were. Where there is moſt grace, there God is moſt honoured, and there Chriſt is moſt exalted, and there the Spirit is beſt pleaſed, and there Religion is moſt adorned, and there Satan is moſt dethroned, and there the world is moſt conquered, and there ſin is moſt ſubdued, and there du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are moſt exactly performed; and therefore, there the gracious ſoul can't but love beſt and moſt. There are ſome that ſeem to love ſuch and ſuch godly men, whoſe judgments
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:52491:119"/> are weak and light, little, and parts low, and grace ſmall; who yet look with a ſquint eye, an envious eye upon every Sun that outſhines their own, upon every ones graces and excellencies that are more ſparkling than their own. Though pride and envy have received their deaths-wound at the ſouls firſt converſion, yet they are not quite ſlain in a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever; there is an aptneſs even in real Saints,<note place="margin">Luk. 7.16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.</note> to grudge and repine at thoſe gifts, graces and excellencies in others that outſhine their own. <hi>John</hi>'s diſciples muttered and murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe Chriſt had more followers and admirers than <hi>John;</hi> and that ſpirit that lived in <hi>John</hi>'s diſciples, is ſtill alive to this very day. This is, and this muſt be for a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Well Sirs, look as the faireſt day hath its clouds, the fineſt linnen its ſpots, the richeſt jewels their flaws, the ſweeteſt fruits their worms; ſo when many precious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are not themſelves, when they are in an hour of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, when their corruptions are up, and their graces down, they may and too often do,<note place="margin">Num. 11.29.</note> envy and repine at thoſe graces, excellencies and abilities that do over-caſt, cloud,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.15.</note> darken and outſhine their own. The beſt of men are but men at the beſt, and there is ſtill thoſe bitter roots of pride, vain-glory, ſelf-love, envy, &amp;c. remaining in them, that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions their hearts to riſe and ſwell, yea ſometimes to caſt diſgrace upon thoſe excellencies in others that themſelves want: As that great man that could not write his own name,<note place="margin">

This ſpiritual diſeaſe is moſtly to be found among Chriſtians that are got into ſome of the higheſt forms in Chriſtianity; take your ordinary common Chriſtians, and they commonly rejoyce moſt where they ſee moſt grace: And ſo do your Chriſtians in a higher form too, when they come to themſelves, and to make up their accounts, and have wept over thoſe curſed roots of bitterneſs that are ſo apt to be ſprouting out. Now, there is no greater argument that our grace is true, and that we do love others for grace ſake, than our loving them beſt that have moſt grace, though they have but little of the world. A pearl is rich if found on a dunghil, though it may gliſter more when ſet in a ring of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:52491:120"/> gold; ſo many a poor believer is rich in grace, and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and glorious in the eye of Chriſt, and ſhould be ſo in ours, though like <hi>Job</hi> he ſits upon a dunghil; though in the eyes of the world he may ſeem to gliſter moſt, when adorned with riches, honour and outward pomp. If grace be the true reaſon why we love any perſon, then the more grace that perſon hath, the more we ſhall love him. A godly man loves all that are godly, but he loves them moſt, that excel moſt in the power, purity and practiſe of godlineſs, &amp;c. But,</p>

                  <hi>The evil that I do I allow not.</hi> 'Tis one thing for a man to ſin, 'tis an other thing for a man to allow himſelf in ſin; 'tis one thing for a godly man to ſtep into a ſin,<note place="margin">Pſal. 139 24.</note> and 'tis another thing to keep the road of ſin. <hi>Search me and try me, and ſee if there be any way of wickedneſs in me</hi> (or as the Hebrew runs, <hi>Any way of pain, or of grief, or of provocation</hi>) that is, any courſe of ſin that is grievous or provoking to the eyes of divine glory. A real Saint can neither allow of ſin, nor wallow in ſin, nor be transformed into the image of ſin, nor mix it ſelf with ſin. 'Tis poſſible for a ſincere Chriſtian to ſtep into a ſinful path, or to touch upon ſinful facts,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.1. Prov. 16.17.</note> and now and then in an hour of temptation, to ſlide, to trip, and to be overtaken unawares; but his main way, his principle work, is to depart from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. As a true traveller may now and then ſtep a few ſteps out of his way, who yet for the main keeps his way, keeps the road; or as a Bee may now and then light upon a thiſtle, but her main work is to be gathering at the flowers; or as a Sheep may now and then ſlip into the dirt, or into a ſlow, but its main work is to be grazing upon the mountains. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, O ſoul, if ſin be now thy greateſt burden, it ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hereafter prove thy eternal bane. God never yet ſent any man to hell for ſin, to whom ſin has commonly been the greateſt hell in this world. God has but one hell, and that is for thoſe to whom ſin has been commonly a heaven in this world. That man that hates ſin, and that daily enters his proteſt againſt ſin, that man ſhall never be made miſerable by ſin. Sin in a wicked man is like poyſon in a ſerpent; it is in its natural place, it is delightful to a ſinner; but ſin in a Saint is like poyſon in a man's body, it is offenſive, and the heart riſes againſt it, and is carried forth to the uſe of all divine Antidotes whereby it may be expelled and deſtroyed; nothing will ſatisfie a gracious ſoul, but the heart bloud of his luſts. Now, he ſhall never be damned for his ſins, whoſe heart is ſet upon killing his ſins.</p>
               <p>Seventeenthly, Such a poor ſoul that dares not ſay, that God is his God; or that Chriſt is his Redeemer, or that he has a work of grace upon his heart; yet can ſay with ſome inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:52491:122"/> of heart before the Lord, that if God and Chriſt, grace and glory, holineſs and happineſs were offered to him on the one hand, and all the honours, pleaſures, profits, delights, and carnal contents of the world were offered him on the other hand, he had infinitely rather ten thouſand thouſand times chuſe God and Chriſt, grace and glory, holineſs and happineſs, than the contrary. Certainly ſuch a ſoul has true grace in him, and a ſaving work paſt upon him; for none can freely, ſeriouſly, habitually, reſolutely, chuſe God and Chriſt, grace and glory, holineſs and happineſs, as their <hi>(ſummum bonum)</hi> chiefeſt good, but ſuch who are really good.<note place="margin">1 John 4.19.

God never did, nor never will, reject thoſe, or damn thoſe, who really chuſe him for their God, and for their great all. The greateſt part of the world chuſe their luſts rather than God, and the creatures rather than Chriſt;<note place="margin">Luke 12.21.</note> they chuſe rather to be great than gracious, to be rich in this world than to be rich towards God, to be outwardly happy than to be inwardly holy,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.42.</note> to have a heaven on earth than to have a heaven after death, and ſo they miſcarry for ever. That ſoul that with <hi>Mary</hi> has choſen the better part, that ſoul with <hi>Mary</hi> ſhall be happy for ever; every man muſt ſtand or fall for ever as his choice has been. But,</p>

Now certainly, there is not the weakeſt Chriſtian in all the world, but can venture himſelf upon ſuch an appeal to God as this is; and without all peradventure, where ſuch a frame and temper of ſpirit is, there the dominion of Jeſus Chriſt is ſet up; and where the dominion of Chriſt is ſet up, there ſin has no dominion; for the dominion of ſin, and the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Chriſt are inconſiſtent, and therefore ſuch a ſoul is happy, and will be happy to all eternity.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, It ſignifies to keep, as the Prieſts and Levites kept the Sanctuary of God, the Temple of God, and all the holy things that were committed to their charge: So the word is often uſed by the Prophet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44.8, 15, 16, &amp;c. The Temple, and all the veſſels of the Temple were to be kept pure, and clean, and ſweet. Our hearts are the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of God, the Temples of the holy Ghoſt; and therefore we ſhould alwayes keep a ſtrong and diligent guard about them, that nothing may paſs in or out, that may be either diſpleaſing, provoking or grieving to them. But,</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, The word ſignifies to keep, as a man keeps his life, <hi>Job</hi> 10.12. <hi>Thy viſitation hath preſerved</hi> (here is <hi>Shamar) my life.</hi> Now with what care, with what diligence, with what labour, with what watchfulneſs do men labour to preſerve their natural lives? what a guard, what a watch do men daily
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:52491:126"/> ſet about their lives; the ſame they ſhould ſet about their hearts. But,</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Men ſhould keep their hearts, as they keep a rich <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> treaſure of money, or jewels, or plate. Now, to preſerve a rich treaſure, what locks, what bolts, what bars,<note place="margin">All our ſpiritual riches are in our hearts. A good man may ſay with <hi>Bias, omnia mea mecum parto,</hi> all my goods I carry about with me.</note> what chains are made uſe of? Our hearts are jewels more worth than all the Kingdoms, Crowns and Scepters of this world. There are few men that know how to value a God, a Chriſt, a Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, a Covenant of grace, a Heaven, or their own hearts, as they ſhould. What are mountains of gold, and rocks of pearl, to the heart, the ſoul of man? The heart is that pearl of price for which a man ſhould venture his all, and lay down his all. O then! what a guard, what a watch ſhould a man continually keep upon his heart? The heart is <hi>Camera omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentis Regis,</hi> the preſence chamber of the King of heaven; and upon this account it becomes a Chriſtian alwayes to keep a guard upon his heart; he keeps his heart beſt who keeps it as his choiſeſt treaſure, &amp;c. But,</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Men ſhould keep their hearts, as a fond father <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> keeps his only child; the fond father will ſtill keep his child within doors, he will ſtill have him under his eye, and in his preſence, that ſo no hurt, no harm may befal him day or night. Our eye ſhould be ſtill upon our hearts, or elſe they will give us the ſlip, and play the wantons with us. But,</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Men ſhould keep their hearts, as Lovers keep <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> the love-tokens that are mutually ſent one to another; they love to be often a looking upon them, and a thinking of them, and a talking of them; and will be ſure to keep the ſtricteſt and the ſtrongeſt guard upon them: So a Chriſtian ſhould ſtill be a looking upon his heart, and a thinking upon his heart, and a ſpeaking of his heart (either of the badneſs of it, or of the wants of it) and a keeping of the ſtricteſt and ſtrongeſt guard upon his heart. But,</p>
               <p>Eighthly, A man ſhould keep his heart as a man keeps his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:52491:127"/> houſe, when he is afraid and in danger of being robbed by thieves in the night. O! how wakeful, and watchful, and active will a man now be? but what's a man's houſe to his heart? A mans heart is in ten thouſand times more danger than his houſe, and accordingly his guard ſhould be moſt about his heart. But,</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Ninthly, A man ſhould keep his heart, as men keep their gardens that are full of choice, rich, rare, ripe fruits and dowers. Now, what care, coſt, and pains men are at to keep ſuch gardens, you well know: And O, that you did but every day more and more experimentally know what it is to ſpend your greateſt care and pains about your hearts, which are Chriſt's garden, his bed of ſpices, where all graces flouriſh! <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. <hi>ult.</hi>

               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Tenthly and laſt, A man ſhould keep his heart, as ſpruce men and women do their fine cloaths; O, they won't endure a ſpeck, a ſpot upon them! 'Tis your wiſdom, and O, that you would more and more make it your work to keep your hearts from all ſinful ſpecks and ſpots! Let not others be more careful to keep their outſides clean, than you are to keep your inſides clean; for what are clean cloaths to a clean heart? 'Tis better to go to heaven in ragged cloaths with a clean heart, than to go to hell in fine cloaths with an unclean heart. Doubtleſs that man that makes it his buſineſs to keep his heart as men keep dangerous Fellons or Traitors, or as ſoldiers keep their Garriſons or Caſtles when cloſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, or as the Prieſts and Levites kept the Sanctuary of God, or as a man keeps his natural life, or as a man keeps a rich treaſure, or as a fond father keeps an only child, or as Lovers keep their love-tokens, or as a man keeps his houſe when he is in danger to be robbed, or as a man keeps his pleaſant garden, or as ſpruce men and women keep their fine cloaths; that man is doubtleſs a true <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> a man that has a work of God paſt in power upon his ſoul; yea that man whoſe ſincere deſires, and whoſe gracious purpoſes, and fixed reſolutions, and faithful endeavours is to guard and watch his
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:52491:127"/> heart, according to the particulars we have now hinted; that man without a peradventure is a gracious man, and one that has the root of the matter in him, and ſhall be happy to all eternity. Look, as no man can hear as he would and ſhould, nor pray as he would and ſhould, nor believe as he would and ſhould, nor repent as he would and ſhould, nor walk as he would and ſhould; ſo no man can keep his heart as he would and ſhould: but if a man makes it his great buſineſs and work to keep his heart, to watch his heart, to reform his heart, to better his heart, he is accepted of God, and ſhall be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for-ever.

Satan has a ſtrong party, a numerous party, an old party, a ſubtil party in all our hearts; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it highly concerns us to watch our hearts with a holy jealouſie: O Sirs!

                  </note> as the heart is the fountain of natural life, and if it fail life fails; and therefore it is ſtrongly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured with ribs about it, it is guarded in a caſtle of fleſh and bones; ſo is the ſoul the fountain of ſpiritual life,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.1. 1 Theſ. 5.13. &amp;c.</note> and runs inviſibly through all the body. Fountains were to be kept pure by the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws of the twelve Tables; and the heart that is the ſpring and fountain of all actions, is to be kept pure by the Laws of the great God. Men keep the heart principally from hurt, becauſe every wound there is mortal. O, that men were as wiſe for their ſouls! God's eye is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

The heart well guarded and watcht, keeps all in ſecurity. <hi>Alexander</hi> was ſafe while <hi>Antipater</hi> kept the watch; ſo all within that little world Man, will be ſafe while the heart is ſtrongly guarded. The heart is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, the root, the ſtore-houſe, the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> the great wheel that ſets all a going; and therefore above all keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings keep your hearts.

O, that my inward man were but in as good a frame as my outward man! O, that this proud heart were but more humble! O, that this hard heart were but more ſoftned!

God meaſures his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple not by their works, but by their wills; if their wills be to be more holy, humble, heavenly, and to have their hearts alwayes in a moſt gracious frame, then they are accepted of God; for every good man is as good in the eye of God, in the judgment of God, and in the account of God, as he would be. Not long before famous Mr. <hi>Banes</hi> died, ſome friends that were with him in his Library (which was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent one) fell a commending of it; <hi>I,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>there ſtand my books, but the Lord knows that for many years loſt paſt, I have ſtudied my heart more than Books.</hi> O, no Miniſter to him, no Scholar to him who ſtudies his heart more than his books; nor no Chriſtian to him who ſtudies his heart more than his day-books, or more than his Shop-books, or that ſtudies his heart more than his counting-houſe, or that ſtudies his heart more than a good bargain, &amp;c. That man is for heaven, and heaven is for that man, who makes it his greateſt buſineſs in this world to watch his heart, to guard his heart; the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite looks moſt to externals, but the ſincere Chriſtian looks moſt to internals; the hypocrites main watch is about his lips, but a ſincere Chriſtians main watch is about his heart; the hypocrites main work lyes without doors, but the ſincere Chriſtians main work lyes within doors. All know that know any thing, that both nature and grace begin at the heart, but art begins at the face. A painter doth not begin a picture at the heart; a picture hath but a face, but an outſide.
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:52491:129"/> And as nature begins at the heart, but art at the face; ſo grace begins at the heart, but hypocriſie at the face, at the outſide of Religion. Every man is that really that he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.<note place="margin">Rom. 2.28, 29.</note>

'Tis true, our hearts are like our watches, ſeldom got to go well; and when they do go well, how hard a work is it to keep them going well? The motions of our watches are not conſtant; ſometimes they go faſter, and ſometimes they go ſlower, and often they ſtand in need of mending. Though in theſe and many other reſpects, our hearts are like our watches, yet if we make it our grand work to keep a conſtant guard upon our hearts, and our main deſign in this world to have our hearts brought and kept in a gracious frame, our ſpiritual eſtate is good, and we ſhall be happy for ever, &amp;c.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Now in this Chapter I ſhall treat of ſound, ſaving re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, of repentance unto Life; yea, of that Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical repentance that hath the precious Promiſes of remiſsion of ſin and ſalvation running out unto it. My purpoſe at this time is not to handle the doctrine of Repentance at large, but only to ſpeak ſo far of it as may ſpeak it out to be evidential of the goodneſs and happineſs of a Chriſtians ſpiritual and eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOw before I come to open my ſelf more particularly, give me leave to premiſe this in the general, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is a repentance that does accompany ſalvation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. <hi>For godly ſorrow worketh repentance to ſalvation not to be repented of, but the ſorrow of the world worketh death.</hi> Jer. 4.14. <hi>O</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>waſh thy heart from wickedneſs, that thou mayeſt be ſaved.</hi> Acts 11.18. <hi>When they heard theſe things, they held their peace, and glorified God, ſaying, Then hath God alſo to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.</hi> Mat. 18.3. <hi>And Jeſus ſaid, verily I ſay unto you, except you be converted and become as little children, ye ſhall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</hi> Acts 3.19. <hi>Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out, when the times of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having premiſed thus much in the general, give me now leave to ſay, That there are three parts of true, ſound, ſaving re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:52491:130"/> unto all which forgiveneſs of ſin is promiſed: And the</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt is contrition or grief of heart for ſins committed. Now this is called ſometimes godly ſorrow, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. and ſometimes a contrite ſpirit, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.2. and ſometimes a broken and contrite heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.17. and ſometimes the afflicting of our ſouls, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.29. and ſometimes the humbling of the heart, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Lamen.</hi> 3.20. and ſometimes a mourning, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. and ſometimes a weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.72. All repenting ſinners are mourning ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. <hi>David</hi> repents and waters his couch with his tears, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> repents and humbles himſelf for the pride of his heart, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.26. <hi>Ephraim</hi> repents, and <hi>Ephraim</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moans himſelf and ſmites upon his thigh, and is even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18, 19. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> repents, and weeps, and waſhes Chriſts feet with her tears, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.38. The <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> repented, and they were made ſorry after a godly manner, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9. Repentance in the Hebrew is called <hi>Nacham,</hi> an irking of the ſoul; and in Greek <hi>Metamelia,</hi> after grief; and <hi>Metanoia,</hi> after wit; and in the Latine, <hi>Poenitentia.</hi> All which do import, that contrition or ſorrow for ſin, is one part of true repentance. O! the ſighs, the groans, the ſobs, the tears, that are to be found among repenting ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luth.</hi> Tom. 3.457.</note> &amp;c. <hi>Luther</hi> hit the Mark, when he ſaid, What are all the Palaces of the world, to a contrite heart; yea, heaven and earth, ſeeing it is the ſeat of divine Majeſty?</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, 'Tis very obſervable, that all mourning perſons for their ſins, are within the compaſs of the promiſe of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.11. <hi>In that day there ſhall be a great mourning in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>as the mourning of</hi> Hadadrimmon <hi>in the valley of</hi> Megiddo, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.1. <hi>In that day there ſhall be a fountain opened to the houſe of</hi> David, <hi>and to the inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>for ſin and for uncleanneſs,</hi> Jer. 31.18. <hi>I have ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard</hi> Ephraim <hi>bemoaning of himſelf, &amp;c.</hi> Ver. 20. <hi>I will ſurely have mercy on him;</hi> or as the Hebrew has it, I will having mercy, have mercy on him.

Ephraim</hi> could not refrain from tears, and God could not refrain from opening his bowels of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy towards him. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15. And how can the contrite heart be indeed revived and cheered without forgiveneſs of ſins, without a pardon in the boſom? <hi>Melancthon</hi> makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a godly woman, who having upon her death-bed been in much conflict, and afterwards much comforted, brake out into theſe words: Now, and not till now, did I underſtand the meaning of theſe words, <hi>Thy ſins are forgiven.</hi> There is no comfort to that which ariſes from the ſenſe of forgiveneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.1, 2. <hi>Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, ſaith your God; ſpeak ye comfortably to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and cry unto her that her ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities are pardoned.</hi> And why is the mourning ſoul pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the bleſſed ſoul, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourn, for they ſhall be comforted</hi>) but becauſe the mourning ſoul is the pardoned ſoul?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But what is that ſorrow or mourning for ſin,</hi>

                  <hi>that is a part of true repentance?</hi> The reſolution of this queſtion is very neceſſary for the preventing of all ſoul-deceits and miſtakes, and for the quieting, ſetling and ſatisfying of ſouls truly penitent; and therefore I ſhall give theſe eight following Anſwers to it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is a ſorrow or grief that is ſpiritual, that is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> no man is born with godly ſorrow in his heart, as he is born with a tongue in his mouth. Godly ſorrow is a plant of God's own planting, 'tis a ſeed of his own ſowing, 'tis a flower of his own ſetting, 'tis of a heavenly off-ſpring, 'tis from God, and God alone: The ſpirit of mourning is from above, 'tis from a ſupernatural power and principle; there is nothing that can turn a heart of ſtone into fleſh, but the ſpirit of God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25, 26. Godly ſorrow is a
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:52491:131"/> gift from God, <hi>Job</hi> 23.16. <hi>God makes my heart ſoft.</hi> No hand but a divine hand can make the heart ſoft and tender under the ſight and ſenſe of ſin. Nature may eaſily work a man to mourn, and melt, and weep, under worldly loſſes, croſſes and miſeries, as it did <hi>David's</hi> men, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.4. But it muſt be grace, it muſt be a ſupernatural principle that muſt work the heart to mourn for ſin.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, godly ſorrow is a ſorrow for ſin as ſin, 'tis a mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning rather for ſin than for ſmart; 'tis not ſo much for loſs of goods, lands, wife, child, credit, name, &amp;c. but for that a holy God is offended, a righteous Law violated, Chriſt diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Spirit grieved, and the Goſpel blemiſhed, &amp;c. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's</hi> ſorrow was godly, but <hi>Judas</hi> his ſorrow was worldly; <hi>Peter</hi> mourns over the evil of ſin, but <hi>Judas</hi> mourns over the evil of puniſhment. <hi>David</hi> mourns over his ſin, <hi>Againſt thee, thee only have I ſinned, and done this evil in thy ſight,</hi> Pſal. 51.4. And ſo 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.10. <hi>And</hi> David's <hi>heart ſmote him after he had numbred the people; and</hi> David <hi>ſaid unto the Lord, I have ſinned greatly in that I have done, and now I beſeech thee, O Lord, take away the iniquity of thy ſervant, for I have done fooliſhly. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> does not cry out, take away the threatned famine, but take away the iniquity of thy ſervant; nor he does not cry out, take away the enemies of thy ſervant, but take away the iniquity of thy ſervant; nor he does not ſay, take away the peſtilence from the Land, but take away the iniquity of thy ſervant. But now when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was under judgments, he never cryes to the Lord to take away his ſins, his pride, his hardneſs, his obdurateneſs, his envy, his malice, his hatred, &amp;c. but he cryes out, take away the judgment, take away the judgment, take away the frogs, take away the lice, take away the caterpillars, &amp;c. But under all theſe dreadful and amazing judgments that he was under, ſuch a word as this never fell from his lips, take away my ſin, O Lord, take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way my ſins; thy judgments do terrifie me, but my ſins will damn me, and therefore what ever becomes of my life, king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and crown, take away my ſins and ſave my ſoul. <hi>David</hi> ſaw ſin to be a greater evil, than flying before his enemies,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:52491:131"/> or than famine or peſtilence was; and therefore he deſires rather to be rid of his ſins, than to be rid of the puniſhment that was due to his ſin; but <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaw no ſuch evil in ſin, and therefore he cryes out, take away the plague, take away the plague. And <hi>Job</hi> upon the dunghil cryes out, <hi>I have ſinned, what ſhall I do unto thee, O thou preſerver of men? Job</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 7.20.</note> does not cry out, O, I have loſt all my ſubſtance, I am bereaved of all my children, I am ſet as naked upon the dunghil as ever I was born; my friends reproach me, my wife tempts me to curſe my God, which is ten thouſand times worſe than to curſe my ſelf; Satan perſecutes me, and God has not only forſaken me, but is alſo become a ſevere enemy to me, &amp;c. <hi>Job</hi> cryes out of his ſin, and not of his ſufferings; a deep ſenſe of his ſins ſwallows up as it were, all ſenſe of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</p>
               <p>And ſo that great Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> does not cry out, O wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man that I am, that bonds attend me in every place, and that I have neither houſe nor home to go to, and that I am deſpiſed, ſcorned, reproached and perſecuted, and that I am accounted factious, ſeditious, rebellious, erronious, and that I am lookt upon as the off-ſcouring of the world, &amp;c. O no, but he cryes out of his ſin; <hi>O wretched man that I am! who ſhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> Rom. 7.23, 24.</p>
               <p>So the Prophet <hi>Micah, I will bear the indignation of the Lord, becauſe I have ſinned, Micah</hi> 7.9. Though of all bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens the indignation of the Lord be the greateſt burden, yet divine indignation is but a light burden in compariſon of ſin. A gracious ſoul can better ſtand under the burden of God's indignation for ſin, than it can ſtand under the burden of ſin it ſelf, which hath kindled that indignation, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Godly ſorrow is a great ſorrow, 'tis a ſuperla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſorrow, 'tis a ſad and ſerious ſorrow; a ſincere mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a deep mourning, it ſprings from ſerious and deep ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the great anger and deep diſpleaſure of God, and of the woful nature, demerit, burden, bitterneſs, vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and filthineſs of ſin, &amp;c. The bleſſed Scripture ſeems to make godly ſorrow a ſuperlative ſorrow, calling it a great
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:52491:132"/> mourning, like the mourning of <hi>Hadadrimmon</hi> in the valley of <hi>Megiddo,</hi> and a bitterneſs, as one is in for his firſt-born, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10, 11. And ſo the Church, <hi>My bowels are troubled within me, mine heart is turned within me; for I have grievouſly re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>elled,</hi> Lamen. 1.20. And <hi>David</hi> watered his couch with his tears, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6.6. And <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> wept much, as Well as ſhe loved much, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. And <hi>Peter</hi> went out and wept bitterly, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. <hi>ult. Clement</hi> obſerves, that all the time that <hi>Peter</hi> lived after this great fall, he would every night, when he heard the cock crow, fall upon his knees and weep bitterly.<note place="margin">Hoſea 7.14.</note> Look, as ſhallow brooks make the greateſt noiſe, ſo hypocrites and formaliſts may howl, and roar, and cry, and make more noiſe than the true penitent; but yet the ſorrow of a true penitent is more inward, ſecret, ſolid, ſtill and deep. As you know the deepeſt Rivers run moſt ſilently, and make leaſt noiſe, ſo the deepeſt ſorrow makes leaſt noiſe. The mourning of repenting ſouls,<note place="margin">Ezek. 7.16. Iſa. 51.20. Iſa. 59.11.</note> under the apprehenſions of their ſins, is like the mourning of Doves; but the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of wicked men under the apprehenſion of their ſins, is like the bellowing of Bulls, and roaring of Bears.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, A ſincere mourning is an extenſive mourning, 'tis an univerſal mourning. Godly ſorrow and grief extends it ſelf, not only to ſome ſins, but to all ſins, great and ſmall. Look, as a holy heart hates all ſin, ſo a holy heart mourns o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all ſin that it ſees and knows to be ſin. God hates one ſin as well as another, and he has forbid one ſin as well as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he has revealed his wrath from heaven againſt one ſin as well as another, and he is provoked by one ſin as well as another, and Chriſt is crucified by one ſin as well as another, and the Spirit is grieved as well by one ſin as by another, and the Goſpel is reproached by one ſin as well as another, and the conſcience is wounded by one ſin as well as another, and Satan is gratified by one ſin as well as another, and wicked mens mouths are opened by one ſin as well as another, and young comers on in Religion are ſtumbled, grieved and offended by one ſin as well as another, and the ſoul is endangered by one ſin as well as another. An unſound
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:52491:132"/> heart may mourn for great ſins, that make great wounds in his conſcience and credit, and that leave a great blot upon his name, or that waſte or rot his body, or deſtroy his eſtate, or that expoſe him to publick ſcorn and ſhame, &amp;c. <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.8-14. but for ſins of omiſſion, for wandring thoughts, idle words, deadneſs, coldneſs, ſlightneſs in religious duties and ſervices, unbelief, ſecret pride, ſelf-confidence, and a thouſand more ſuch gnats as theſe he can ſwallow without any remorſe.</p>
               <p>But now godly ſorrow is of a general extent, it mourns as well for ſmall ſins as for great. <hi>Davids</hi> heart ſmote him, as well for cutting off the lap of <hi>Saul's</hi> garment, as it did for killing of <hi>Uriah</hi> with the ſword. A gracious ſoul weeps o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver many ſins, that none can charge upon him but God and his own conſcience, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.12. <hi>O cleanſe thou me from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret faults.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, let me ſay that godly ſorrow and grief extends not only to a man's own ſins, but alſo to the ſins of others as well as his own, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.4, 5. And this you may ſee alſo in <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.53, 136, 158. And in <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Jer. 9.1, 2, 3. And in <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 3.18. And in <hi>Lot,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.7, 8. And if you pleaſe to turn to my Treatiſe on Holineſs, you may ſee ſeven ſpecial arguments for this their practiſe, Page 139 to pag. 145. and therefore a touch in this place may ſuffice.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Godly ſorrow is a laſting ſorrow, 'tis a durable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> ſorrow; as long as a Chriſtian continues ſinning, he can't but continue mourning. <hi>David's</hi> ſins were alwayes before him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.3. though his <hi>Abſalom</hi> nor his <hi>Bathſheba</hi> were not ever before him. Godly ſorrow will every day follow ſin hard at hells. Look, as a wicked man (in reſpect of his deſire and will to ſin) would ſin for ever, if he ſhould live for ever; ſo I may ſay, if a godly man ſhould live for ever, he would ſorrow for ever. After <hi>Paul</hi> had been converted many years (ſome think fourteen) you ſhall find him a mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and lamenting over his ſins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. An ingenious child will never ceaſe mourning, till he ceaſes from offending an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent father. Though ſin and godly ſorrow were never
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:52491:133"/> born together, yet whilſt a believer lives in this world, they muſt live together. And indeed holy joy and godly ſorrow are no wayes inconſiſtent, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.11. yea, a godly man's eyes are alwayes fulleſt of tears, when his heart is fulleſt of holy joy, &amp;c. A man may go joying and mourning to his grave, yea to heaven at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>But now the ſorrow, the grief of wicked men for ſin, 'tis like a morning cloud, or the early dew, or the crackling of thorns under a pot, or a Poſt that quickly paſſeth by, or a dream that ſoon vaniſheth, or like a tale that is told, &amp;c. their ſorrowful hearts and mournful eyes ſoon dry up together. As you may ſee in <hi>Eſau, Ahab, Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Judas;</hi> but the ſtreams of godly ſorrow will laſt and run, as long as ſin hangs upon us, and dwells in us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.9. <hi>I am the leaſt of the Apoſtles, that am not meet to be called an Apoſtle, becauſe I perſecuted the Church of God.</hi> Pſal. 25.7. <hi>Remember not the ſins of my youth, nor my tranſgreſſions. David</hi> prayeth to the Lord, not only to forgive but alſo to forget, both the ſins of his youth, and the ſins of his age. <hi>David</hi> remembred all his faults, both of former and of later times. <hi>David</hi> was well in years when he defiled himſelf with <hi>Bathſheba;</hi> and this he remembers and mourns over, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. And 'tis very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that God charged his people for to remember old ſins, <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.7. <hi>Remember and forget not how thou provokedſt the Lord thy God to wrath in the wilderneſs.</hi> Repentance is a grace, and muſt have its daily operation as well as other graces, witneſs the very covenant of grace it ſelf, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.62, 63. <hi>I will eſtabliſh my covenant with thee, and thou ſhalt know that I am the Lord, that thou mayeſt remember and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, becauſe of thy ſhame, when I am pacified towards thee for all that thou haſt done.</hi> Certainly a true penitent can no more ſatisfie himſelf with one act of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, than he can ſatisfie himſelf with one act of faith, or or with one act of hope, or with one act of love, or with one act of humility, or with one act of patience, or with one act of ſelf-denial. Godly ſorrow is a Goſpel-grace that will live and laſt as well and as long as other graces, 'tis a ſpring that in this life can never be drawn dry.</p>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:52491:133"/>
               <p>Sixthly, Godly ſorrow is a divorcing ſorrow, it divorces <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> the heart from ſin, it breaks that ancient league that has been between the heart and ſin;<note place="margin">It is an excellent ſaying of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> He doth truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail the ſins he hath committed, who never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the ſins he hath bewailed.</note> there is a ſtrong firm league be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween every ſinner and his ſin, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.15, 18. but when god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow enters, it diſſolves that league, it ſeparates between a ſinner and his ſin, it ſets the ſoul at an everlaſting diſtance from ſin. The union between the root and the branches, the foundation and the building, the head and the members, the father and the child, the husband and the wife, the body and the ſoul are all neer, very neer unions; yet that between a ſinner and his ſin ſeems to be a neerer union. Obſervable is the ſtory of <hi>Phaltiel.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 3.14, 15, 16.</note> You know when <hi>David</hi> had married <hi>Michol, Saul</hi> injuriouſly gave her to another; but when <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> came to the crown, and ſent forth his Royal commands that his wife ſhould be brought to him, her husband dares not but obey, brings her on her journey, and then not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great reluctancy of ſpirit, takes his leave of her. But what was <hi>Phaltiel</hi> weary of his wife, that he now forſakes her? O no, he was enforced, and though ſhe was gone, yet he had many a ſad thought about parting with her, and he never leaves looking till he ſees her as far as <hi>Baharim,</hi> weeping and bemoaning her abſence. Juſt thus ſtands the heart of every unregenerate man towards his ſins, as <hi>Phaltiel's</hi> heart ſtood towards his wife. But when the ſprings of godly ſorrow riſe in the ſoul, the league, the friendſhip, the union that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſinner and his ſins, comes to be diſſolved and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in pieces, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 14.8. All godly ſorrow ſets the heart againſt ſin; he that divinely mourns over ſin, can't live in a courſe of ſin; when of all bitters God makes ſin to be the greateſt bitter to the ſoul, then the ſoul bids an everlaſting farewel to ſin; now the ſoul in good earneſt bids adieu to ſin for ever. O Sirs!<note place="margin">☜</note> this is a moſt certain Maxim (to live and die with) that either a mans ſins will make an end of his mourning, or elſe his mourning will make an end of his ſin; for he that holds on ſinning, will certainly leave off mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (no man can make a trade of ſin, and yet keep his heart in a mourning frame) but he that holds on mourning for ſin, will certainly leave off the trade of ſin, holy grief for ſin,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:52491:134"/> will ſooner or later break off all leagues and friendſhips with ſin.<note place="margin">Iſa. 59.1, 2.</note> As ſin makes a ſeparation between God and a man's ſoul, ſo godly ſorrow makes a ſeparation between a man's ſoul and his ſin. All holy mournings over ſin, will by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees iſſue in the waſting and weakning of the ſtrength and power of ſin, nothing below the death and deſtruction of ſin will ſatisfie that ſoul that truly mourns over ſin.</p>
               <p>But now, though you may find an unſound heart ſometimes a lamenting over his ſins, yet you ſhall never find him a leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off his ſins. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> lamented over his ſin, crying out, <hi>I have ſinned,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 9.27. &amp; 10.16.</note> 
                  <hi>the Lord is righteous, and I and my people are wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> And again, <hi>Then</hi> Pharaoh <hi>called for</hi> Moſes <hi>and for</hi> Aaron <hi>in haſte, and he ſaid, I have ſinned againſt the Lord your God, and againſt you.</hi> But though you find him here lamenting and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining over his ſin, yet you never find him leaving or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking of his ſin. So <hi>Saul</hi> could cry out, he had ſinned, but yet he ſtill continued in his ſin; he acknowledged that he did evil in perſecuting of <hi>David,</hi> and yet he ſtill held on perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of him. An unſound heart mourns over ſin, and yet he holds on in a courſe of ſin; he ſins and mourns, and mourns and ſins, and commonly all his mourning for ſin does but the more imbolden him in a way of ſin; but the gracious ſoul ſayes with <hi>Job,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 34.32.</note> 
                  <hi>If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more.</hi> He laments over ſin and leaves it, he confeſſes it and forſakes it, and he is as willing to forgo it, as he is willing that God ſhould forgive it.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventhly, All (and if you pleaſe I ſhall give you many things in one) godly ſorrow is the fruit and effect of Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical faith, it flows from faith as the ſtream from the fountain, the branch from the root, and the effect from the cauſe, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. <hi>They ſhall look upon him whom they have pierced, and ſhall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only ſon, and ſhall be in bitterneſs for him, as one that is in bitterneſs for his firſt-born.</hi> Look, as all legal ſorrow flows from a legal faith, as you may ſee in <hi>Ahab's</hi> and the <hi>Ninevites,</hi> ſo all Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical ſorrow flows from an Evangelical faith; <hi>They ſhall look
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:52491:134" rendition="simple:additions"/> upon him whom they have pierced, and mourn.</hi> All gracious mourning flows from looking, from believing; nothing breaks the heart of a ſinner like a look of faith; all tears of godly ſorrow drop from the eye of faith; godly ſorrow riſes and falls, as faith riſes and falls; faith and godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row are like the fountain and the floud, which riſe and fall together. The more a man is able by faith to look upon a pierced Chriſt, the more his heart will mourn over all the diſhonours that he has done to Chriſt; the more deep and wide the wounds are that faith ſhews me in the heart and ſides of Chriſt, the more my heart will be wounded for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Again, godly ſorrow is not an enemy, but a friend to holy joy. I have read of a holy man, who lying upon his ſick bed, and being askt which were his joyfulleſt dayes that ever he had, cryed out, <hi>O give me my mourning dayes, give me my mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dayes again, for they were the joyfulleſt dayes that ever I had.</hi> The higher the ſprings of godly ſorrow riſe, the higher the tydes of holy joy riſe; his graces will flouriſh moſt, who Evangelically mourns moſt. Grace alwayes thrives beſt in that garden (that heart) that is watered moſt with the tears of godly ſorrow. He that grieves moſt for ſin, will rejoyce moſt in God; and he that rejoyces moſt in God, will grieve moſt for ſin.</p>
               <p>Again, the more a man apprehends of the love of God, and of the love of Chriſt; and the more a man taſtes and is aſſured of the love of the Father, and of the love of the Son, the more that perſon will grieve and mourn, that he has offended, provoked and grieved ſuch a Father, and ſuch a Son. Remember this, as a man's aſſurance of peace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God riſes, ſo his grief for ſin riſes; the more clear and certain evidences a man has of the love and favour of God to his ſoul, the more that man will grieve and mourn for ſinning againſt ſuch a God. There is nothing that thaws and melts the heart, that ſoftens and breaks the heart, like the warm beams of divine love; as you may ſee in the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:52491:135"/> caſe of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> Luk. 7. ſhe loved much, and ſhe wept much, for much was forgiven her; a ſight of the free grace and love of Chriſt towards her, in an act of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, broke her heart all in pieces. A man can't ſtand under the ſhinings of divine love with a frozen heart, nor yet with dry eyes; the more a man ſees of the love of Chriſt, and the more a man taſtes and enjoys of the love of Chriſt, the more that man will grieve and mourn for all the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours that he has done to Chriſt. The more an ingenious child ſees, and taſtes, and enjoys of his fathers love, the more he grieves and mourns that ever he ſhould offend ſuch a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or provoke ſuch a father, who has been ſo loving and indulgent towards him. Injuries done to a friend cut deep, and the more near, and dear, and beloved a man's friend is to him, the more a man is afflicted and troubled for any wrongs or injuries that are done to him; and juſt ſo 'tis between God and a gracious ſoul.</p>
               <p>The free love and favour of God, and his unſpeakable goodneſs and mercy manifeſted in Jeſus Chriſt to poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, is the very ſpring and fountain of all Evangelical ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; nothing breaks the heart of a poor ſinner like the ſight of God's free love in a Redeemer. A man can't ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly look upon the firſtneſs, the freeneſs, the greatneſs, the unchangeableneſs, the everlaſtingneſs, and the matchleſsneſs of God's free favour and love in Chriſt, with a hard heart, or with dry eyes, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.31. compared with verſ. 25, 26. O! who is there that has but one ſpark of ingenuity, that can read over that heart-breaking Scripture with dry eyes? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.22, 23, 24.<note place="margin">See Iſa. 57.17, 18, 19.</note> 
                  <hi>But thou haſt not called upon me, O</hi> Jacob, <hi>but thou haſt been weary of me, O</hi> Iſrael; <hi>thou haſt not brought me the ſmall cattel of thy burnt offerings, neither haſt thou honoured me with thy ſacrifices, I have not cauſed thee to ſerve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incenſe; thou haſt bought me no ſweet cane with money, neither haſt thou filled me with the fat of thy ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but thou haſt made me to ſerve with thy ſins, thou haſt wearied me with thine iniquities,</hi> Now a man would think, after all this horrid abuſe put upon God, this would certainly follow:
<pb facs="tcp:52491:135"/> Therefore I will plague and puniſh thee, therefore my wrath ſhall ſmoak againſt thee, therefore my ſoul ſhall ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor thee, therefore I will ſhut up my loving kindneſs in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt thee, therefore I will ſhew no more mercy towards thee, therefore I will hide my face for ever from thee, therefore I will take vengeance on thee, therefore I will rain hell out of heaven upon thee, &amp;c. O! but read and wonder, read and admire, read and ſtand amazed and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, read and refrain from tears if thou canſt, ver. 25. <hi>I, even I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for mine own ſake, and will not remember thy ſins.</hi> The Prophets expreſſion in that, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. is very obſervable; <hi>They ſhall look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourn for him, as one that mourneth for his only ſon.</hi> Now 'tis obſervable in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers mourning for an only ſon, there is nothing but pure love, ſincere love, hearty love; but in a ſons mourning for his father, there may be and often is a great deal of ſelf-love, ſelf-reſpect, becauſe the child may run and read in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's death, his own loſs, his own ruin, his own undoing; but in the father's mourning for an only ſon, a man may run and read the integrity, purity, and ingenuity of the father's love; and 'tis only ſuch a love as this as ſets the ſoul a mourning and a lamenting over a crucified Chriſt. The thoughts and fears of wrath, of hell, and of condemnation, works unſound hearts to mourn; but 'tis the ſight of a bleeding, dying Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour that ſets ingenious, gracious ſouls a mourning.</p>

The true penitent has no ways to cleer himſelf, but by arraigning, judging and condemning of himſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31. For if we would judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged.

                  </gap>, wrath unto grief; it notes the very riſing of the ſtomack with rage, and a being angry unto fretting, fuming and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Again, it notes the very heighth of anger and rage. The true penitent is not ſo exceeding angry with himſelf for any thing, as he is angry with himſelf for his ſins. Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here imports the turning of all the paſſions of the ſoul wholly againſt ſin. There are no men in the world ſo hot and angry againſt themſelves for their ſins,<note place="margin">Iſa. 2.20.</note> as penitents are; witneſs thoſe that polluted the Idols that they had perfumed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.22. witneſs <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 73.22. witneſs <hi>Ephraim, Hoſea</hi> 14.8. and witneſs <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7.22, 23.

'Tis not this thing, nor that, nor this enemy, nor that, nor this party, nor that, nor this deſign, nor that; but ſin that is the main, the grand object of a penitents hatred, ſcorn, wrath, rage, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, diſgrace and contempt, &amp;c. He that would be angry and ſin not, muſt be angry at nothing but ſin. If ſome men would but ſpend more of their anger and indignation againſt their ſins, they would not be ſo angry as they are with their brethren, that in diſputable things differ from them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Yea what fear of God's diſpleaſure,<note place="margin">4. Concomitant of godly ſorrow.</note> and of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any more ſo wickedly before the Lord. Penitent ſouls are of all ſouls the moſt trembling ſouls, the moſt timerous ſouls, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.14. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth alwayes.</hi> The penitent Chriſtian has ſtill a jealous eye upon his own heart, words and wayes; he is very apt to ſuſpect a ſnake under eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry flower, and to fear a ſnare in every creature-comfort. The burnt child dreads the fire; he that has been once ſtung hates a ſnake, he that has been in danger of drowning, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles at the thoughts of going by water; and he that has once broke his leg, rides and walks with a fear of diligence and vigilancy all his life after. I have read of the Dove, that ſhe is afraid of every feather that hath grown upon a Hawk; the very ſight of any of the Hawks feathers, brings as much ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror upon her, as if ſhe ſaw the Hawk her ſelf; ſuch a native dread is (it ſeems) implanted in her, that it deteſts and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors the very ſight of any ſuch feather. In every penitent God implants ſuch a holy fear, ſuch a filial fear, ſuch a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rential fear, ſuch a fear of diligence and vigilancy, that the penitent Chriſtians heart riſes, deteſts and abhors, not only groſs ſins, but the leaſt motions, inclinations and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ſin. They that have paid dear for paſt guilt, that have known what an aking heart, a wounded conſcience, and a bleeding ſoul means, that have experienced what the frowns of God, the threatnings of God, and the wrath of God means, will certainly beware of ſin, watch and war againſt it, and fear to fall into it.</p>

                  </gap>, it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies ſuch a deſire of fervency, that can admit of no delay; it notes ſuch a deſire as produces diligence, activity, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry. The true penitent is full of fervent and vehement de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be rid of his ſins; <hi>Rachel</hi> was never more vehement and fervent in her deſires after children, nor <hi>David</hi> after the water of the well <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> nor the hunted Hart after the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-brooks, nor the betrothed Virgin for her marriage day, nor the Apprentice for his freedom, nor the Captive for his ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, nor the Soldier for the conqueſt, nor the ſick Man for his cure, nor the condemned Man for his pardon, than the true penitent is vehement and fervent in his deſires to have his luſts ſubdued,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.22, 23, 24</note> mortified and deſtroyed. Many a day have I ſought death with tears (ſaid bleſſed <hi>Cowper</hi>) not out of diſtruſt, impatience or perturbation, but becauſe I am weary of ſin, and fearful of falling into it. If you ask the penitent, why do you hear, pray, read, and apply your ſelf ſo ſeriouſly, ſo frequently, ſo unweariedly, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to all ſin-ſubduing adminiſtrations? he will tell you, 'tis out of a vehement and fervent deſire that he has to he rid of his ſins. If you ask him again, why he is ſo much in complaining againſt ſin, in mourning over ſin, and in war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt ſin? &amp;c. he will tell you, out of a vehement and earneſt deſire that he has to be fully and finally delivered from ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">6. Concomitant of godly ſorrow.</note>Sixthly, Yea what zeal. Zeal is an extream heat of all the affections ſet againſt ſin, and working ſtrongly towards God. <hi>David's</hi> zeal did eat up his ſin as well as himſelf. And <hi>Paul</hi> was as zealous in propagating the Goſpel, as he had been furious in perſecuting of it. Many mens zeal is hot and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when ſcorns and reproaches are caſt upon them; but the penitent man's zeal is moſt hot and burning, when Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is ſcorned, Saints perſecuted, truth endangered, and the great and dreadful name of God blaſphemed, &amp;c. The zeal of a true penitent will carry him on in a courſe of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and in a courſe of mortification, in ſpight of all the diverſions and oppoſitions that the world, the fleſh, and
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:52491:137" rendition="simple:additions"/> the devil can make. Holy zeal is a fire that will make its way through all things, that ſtands between God and the ſoul. The true penitent is unchangably reſolved to be hid of his ſins what ever it coſt him; who ever eſcapes, who ever lives, he is fully determined his luſts ſhall die for it; only remember this, though zeal ſhould eat up our ſins, yet it muſt not eat up our wiſdom, no more than policy ſhould eat up our zeal.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Yea what revenge. The true penitent revenges himſelf upon himſelf for his ſins,<note place="margin">7.

Holy revenge will ſhew it ſelf by contradicting of corrupt ſelf, and by a ſevere chaſtiſing and puniſhing of all thoſe inſtruments that have been ſervants to the fleſh; as you may ſee by the daughters of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating their looking-glaſſes, by which they had offended,<note place="margin">Exod. 38.8.</note> to the ſervice of the Sanctuary;<note place="margin">Acts 19.19.</note> and as you may ſee by the <hi>Epheſians</hi> burning of their coſtly and curious books before all men;<note place="margin">Luke 7.</note> and by <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And ſo bleſſed <hi>Cranmer</hi> thruſt his right hand firſt into the fire, that being the hand by which he ſubſcribed the Popiſh Articles, revengfully crying out, This unworthy right hand, this unworthy right hand, as long as he could ſpeak.

I have read of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> that when he ſaw a pit full of the bloud of his enemies, he cryed out with much content and delight, O, beautiful ſight! So when a penitent Chriſtian ſees his ſpiritual enemies, his ſtrong corruptions, all in a goar bloud. O! how delightfully and rejoycingly does he cry out, O, beautiful ſight!

O Sirs! let no man deceive his own immortal ſoul; for 'tis moſt certain, that repentance to life hath all theſe lively companions attending of it. Sound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and the companions of it, are born together, and will live and continue together till the penitent ſoul changes earth for heaven, grace for glory. And let thus much ſuffice for the firſt part of true repentance, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The ſecond part of true repentance lyes in confeſſion of ſin, which flows out of a contrite heart; I mean, not a bare, formal, empty confeſſion (ſuch as is common amongſt the worſt of ſinners, as that we are all ſinners, and ſtand in need of a Saviour, God help us, God be merciful unto us, &amp;c.) but of ſuch a confeſſion of ſin as ariſeth from a true ſight and full ſenſe of ſin, and from the due apprehenſions of a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Law that is tranſgreſſed, and a holy God that is provoked, &amp;c. When tongue and heart goes together, when the tongue ſpeaks out of the abundance of the heart, when the tongue is the faithful interpreter of the heart, freely, ingenuouſly and humbly acknowledging iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin; and the penitent judging himſelf worthy of death, of wrath, of hell, and unworthy of the leaſt mercy and favour from God, &amp;c.</p>

The true penitent confeſſes his ſins with much candour, ingenuity and freedom of ſpirit; he is as free in his confeſſion of ſin, as he has been free in the commiſſion of ſin; his confeſſions are like water which runs out of a ſpring with a voluntary freeneſs, but the confeſſions of wicked men are like water that is forced out of a ſtill with fire; their confeſſions are forced and extracted meerly from ſence of pain and ſmart, or from fear of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> never confeſt his ſin till God brought him to the rack,<note place="margin">Exod. 10.16. 1 Sam. 15.24.

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:52491:139"/> are commonly extorted or ſqueezed out, either by ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward trouble, or by ſome inward diſtreſs; but penitential confeſſion is free and ingenuous, ariſing from an inward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of ſin, and from the contrariety of the heart to ſin; and therefore were there no rod, no rack, ho wrath, no hell, the true penitent would very freely and readily confeſs his ſins; when God is moſt free in beſtowing of mercies, then are they moſt free in confeſſing their iniquities, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.1, 2, 3, 4.

A true Penitent is much in confeſſing and lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over that ſecret pride, that ſecret fleſhlineſs, that ſecret worldlineſs, that ſecret hypocriſie, that ſecret vain glory, &amp;c. that is only obvious to God and his own ſoul. But 'tis quite otherwiſe with wicked men; for they confeſs their groſſer ſins, but never obſerve their leſſer ſins; they confeſs their open ſins, but never lay open their ſecret ſins. <hi>Cain</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes his murdering of his brother, but never confeſſes his ſecret enmity that put him upon waſhing his hands in his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's bloud. <hi>Pharoah</hi> confeſſes his oppreſſion of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but he does not confeſs the pride of his heart, nor the hardneſs of his heart. <hi>Judas</hi> confeſſes his betraying of innocent blood, but he never confeſſes his covetouſneſs, that put him upon betraying of the Lord of glory. And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have confeſt their Apoſtacy, who have never confeſt their hypocriſie that hath led them to Apoſtacy, &amp;c. Well, this is certain, that thoſe little ſins, thoſe ſecret ſins, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver break a ſinners ſleep, do often break a believers heart.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, As true penitential confeſſion is full, ſo 'tis ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, 'tis cordial; 'tis not a feigned, nor a formal, nor a meer verbal confeſſion, but an affectionate confeſſion; 'tis a confeſſion that has the mind, the heart, the ſoul as well as the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:52491:140"/> lip in it.<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.31. Jer. 18.19, 20. Iſa. 26.8, 9. Ezra 9.6. Pſal. 38.4. Job 42.6 Luke 18.13.</note> The penitent man's confeſſion ſprings from inward impreſſions of grace upon his ſoul, he heels what he confeſſes, and his affections go along with his confeſſions. The poor Publican ſmote upon his breaſt and confeſſed. Look, as the ſick man opens his diſeaſe to his Phyſician, feelingly, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately; and as the Client opens his caſe to his Lawyer, feelingly, affectionately; ſo the penitent opens his caſe, his heart to God, feelingly, affectionately; cold, careleſs, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal, formal, cuſtomary confeſſions are no ſmall abominations in the eye of God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.2. Such mens confeſſions will be their condemnations at laſt, their tongues will one day cut their throats; though confeſſion to men is a work of the voice, yet confeſſion to God muſt be the voice of the heart. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the heart alone is ſufficient without the voice, as you may ſee in <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.13, 14, 15. but the voice is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſufficient without the heart, as you may ſee in that, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.13. Such who make confeſſion of ſin to be only a lip-labour, ſuch inſtead of offering the calves of their lips (as the Prophet requires, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 14.2.) do but offer the lips of calves. Heart-confeſſions (without words) ſhall be effectual with God, and carry the day in heaven, when all formal, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal confeſſions, though they are never ſo eloquent or excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, ſhall be caſt as dung in ſinners faces, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.12-16. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> weeps, and ſighs, and ſobs,<note place="margin">Luke 7.38.</note> but ſpeaks neve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Wicked men do no more taſte nor reliſh the evil of ſin, the poyſon of ſin, the bitterneſs of ſin in any of their confeſſions, than the pipe does taſte or reliſh the water that runs through it. Such who confeſs ſin formally, or rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torically, and yet love ſin dearly, heartily, ſhall never get good by their confeſsions; certainly ſuch confeſsions will never reach the heart of God, that do not reach our own hearts; nor ſuch confeſsions will never affect the heart of

               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, As penitential confeſsion is ſincere and cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,<note place="margin">Ezra 10.3.</note> ſo 'tis diſtinct and not confuſed. The true penitent has his particular and ſpecial bills of indictment, he knows his ſins of omiſsion, and his ſins of commiſsion; he remembers the ſins that he hath moſt rejoyced and delighted in, he can't for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the ſins that have had moſt of his eye, his ear, his head, his hand, his heart; the by-paths in which he has moſt walked, and the tranſgreſsions by which God has been moſt diſhonoured, his conſcience moſt wounded, and his corrupt nature moſt pleaſed &amp; gratified,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.3.</note> are always before him. An implicite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion is almoſt as bad as an implicite faith; wicked men c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mmonly confeſs their ſins by whole-ſale, we are all ſinners; but the true penitent confeſſes his ſins by retail. Though it cant't be denied but that in ſome caſes a general confeſsion may be penitent,<note place="margin">Luke 18.13.</note> as you ſee in the Publican, <hi>God be merciful to me a ſinner;</hi> yet it muſt be granted, that a true penitent can't content nor ſatisfie himſelf with a general confeſsion. And therefore <hi>David</hi> confeſſes his particular ſins of adultery and bloud-guiltineſs,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.13.</note> and <hi>Paul</hi> particularizeth his ſins of blaſphemy, and perſecution, and injuriouſneſs againſt the Saints. And more you have of this in that, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.10, 11. <hi>Which thing I alſo did in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and many of the Saints did I ſhut up in priſon, having received authority from the chief Prieſts; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice againſt them; and I puniſhed them oft in every Synagogue, and compelled them to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme; and being exceedingly mad againſt them, I perſecuted them even unto ſtrange Cities.</hi> So <hi>Judg.</hi> 10.10. <hi>And the children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>cryed unto the Lord, ſaying, we have ſinned againſt thee, both becauſe we have forſaken our God, and alſo ſerved</hi> Balaam. <hi>We have ſinned,</hi> there is their general confeſsion; <hi>we have forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken our God, and alſo ſerved Balaam,</hi> there is their diſtinct and particular confeſsion, both of their Apoſtacy and Idolatry. And ſo 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.19. <hi>And all the people ſaid unto</hi> Samuel, <hi>pray
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:52491:141"/> for thy ſervants unto the Lord thy God, that we dye not, for we have added unto all our ſins this evil, to ask us a King.</hi> They were diſcontented with that government that the Lord had ſet over them, and they would need; be governed by a King, after the mode of other Nations; and this ſin they confeſs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly and particularly before the Lord and <hi>Samuel.</hi> And ſo <hi>David</hi> in that, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.17. <hi>And</hi> David <hi>ſaid unto God, is it not I that commanded the people to be numbred? even I it is that have ſinned and done evil indeed; but as for theſe ſheep, what have they done?</hi> Thus that princely Prophet confeſſes that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſin that he then lay under the guilt of. And ſo <hi>Zacheus</hi> makes a particular confeſsion, he does as it were point with his finger at that wrong and injuſtice that he had been guilty of; <hi>Behold Lord, half my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man, by falſe accuſation, I reſtore him fourfold.</hi> Thus you ſee that true penitents make a particular confeſsion of their right eye ſins, and of their right hand ſins; and indeed, what is confeſsion of ſin, but a ſetting our ſins in order before the Lord? and how can this be done but by a diſtinct and particular enumeration of them? But to prevent miſtakes, this muſt be taken with a grain of ſalt, this muſt be underſtood with this limitation; we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs our ſins diſtinctly, particularly, ſo far as we know them, ſo far as we are acquainted with them. There are many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſins which we commit, that we know not to be ſins, and there are many thouſand ſins committed by us, that can't be remembred by us. Now certainly it is impoſsible for us to recount or confeſs thoſe ſins that we know not, that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not; ſo that our particular confeſsions can only reach to known ſins, ſo far as we can call them to mind; for indeed our particular acts of ſin are innumerable, they are more in number than the hairs of our head; and indeed, we are as well able to tell the ſtairs of heaven, and to number the ſands of the Sea, and to recount all the ſparing mercies, the pitying mercies, the preventing mercies, the ſuccouring mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, the ſupporting mercies, and the delivering mercies of God, as we are able to tell, to number, to recount, the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual particular acts of ſin that we are guilty of; yet ſo far
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:52491:142"/> as the knowledge and memory of a penitent Chriſtian rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſo far his confeſsion reaches. But now, wicked men confeſs ſin in the general, in the lump; as <hi>Tharaoh,</hi> I have ſinned; and their con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſsions are commonly confuſed, and at random. When and where do you find wicked men confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their ſins diſtinctly or particularly before God or man? this is none of the leaſt of their miſeries, that they have not a clear, diſtinct, particular view of their own corruptions and abominations. But,</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, The true penitent does not only diſtinctly and particularly confeſs his ſins, but he does very highly aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate his ſins,<note place="margin">Pſal. 32.5. Levit. 16.21.</note> by confeſsing not only the kinds and acts (ſo far as he knows and remembers them) but the circumſtances of them alſo. There are (ſometimes) ſome circumſtances that may ſomewhat leſſen a penitent mans ſins; now theſe he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and eaſily paſſes over, but then there are other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which do exceedingly heighten and aggravate his ſins, and that makes them more hainous and dangerous; and theſe he carefully and faithfully acknowledges. The penitential confeſsions recorded in the old and new Teſtament, are full of exaggerating expreſsions, as is evident in theſe inſtances. <hi>Ezra</hi> at once heightens and aggravates their ſins by this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, that they had been committed againſt manifold experiments that they had had, both of the ſeverity, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the mercy of the Lord, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. and ſo does <hi>Nehemiah</hi> alſo, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. The like inſtance you have in <hi>Daniel,</hi> Chap. 9. 5, 6. <hi>We have ſinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts, and from thy judgments: neither have we hearkened unto thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants the Prophets which ſpake in thy Name, to our Kings, our Princes and our Fathers, and to all the people of the Land.</hi> In theſe words you have ſeven circumſtances that <hi>Daniel</hi> uſeth in confeſsing of his and the peoples ſins, and all to heighten and to aggravate them. Firſt, <hi>We have ſinned.</hi> Secondly, <hi>We have committed iniquity.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>We have done wickedly.</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>We have rebelled againſt thee.</hi> Fifthly, <hi>We have departed from thy percepts.</hi> Sixthly, <hi>We have not hearkened unto thy ſervants.</hi>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:52491:142"/> Seventhly, <hi>Nor our Princes, nor all the people of the Land.</hi> Theſe ſeven aggravations which <hi>Daniel</hi> reckons up in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, are worthy of our moſt ſerious conſideration. The ſame ſpirit you may find working in <hi>Peter,</hi> Mark 14.72. <hi>When he thought thereon be wept;</hi> or neerer the Original; <hi>When he caſt all theſe things one upon another, he wept.</hi> Ah wretch! that ever I was born, that ever I ſhould deny the Lord that bought me; that ever I ſhould deny him who hath, not only externally, but alſo internally called me; that ever I ſhould deny him that made me an Apoſtle, that fed me at his table, that beautified me with his grace, and that in the Mount ſhew'd me ſome glimpſes of his glory; that ever I ſhould deny him who has brought me out of a ſtate of death and wrath, into a ſtate of life and love; that ever I ſhould deny him that has been the beſt, the wiſeſt, the holieſt, the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, the faithfulleſt, and the nobleſt Maſter that ever man ſerved. Ah, wretch that I am! he forewarned me of this ſin before-hand, that I might be not only cautioned but armed againſt it, and yet I denied him; I promiſed him before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, that I would never deny him, that I would never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him, that I would never turn my back upon him, and yet like a baſe coward, I have denied the captain of my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; yea, this very night, and no longer ago, did I ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and again, that I would not deny him, and yet now, even now, I have moſt ſhamefully denied him; yea, I told him, that though all others, ſhould deny him, yet would not I deny him, and yet in all the world there is not ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be found, that has ſo ſadly, ſo deſperately denied him, as I have denied him, and that before a ſilly Maid; nay, more beaſt that I am to my denying of him. I have added a moſt incredible lye, ſaying, I know not the man, when there was not a man in all the world that I was ſo well acquainted with as I was with Chriſt, feeding conſtantly at his table,<note place="margin">There was ſcarce any Jew, which knew not Chriſt by ſight, he being very famous for the many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that were wrote by him.</note> and drinking conſtantly of his cup, and living conſtantly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his purſe, and waiting conſtantly upon his perſon, and being a conſtant eye-witneſs of all the famous miracles that were wrought by him; nay, yet more monſter that I am, I did not only lye, but I alſo bound that lye with an hideous Oath, I
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:52491:143"/> did not only ſay that I knew not the man, but I alſo ſwore I knew not the man; nay, yet more than all this, I did not only baſely deny him, I did not only tell an incredible lye againſt my own light and conſcience, I did not only bind a fearful lye with a hideous oath, but I alſo fell a curſing and damning of my ſelf, for ſo much the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> imports; I wiſht that the curſe, the wrath or vengeance of God might fall upon me if I knew the man, I wiſht my ſelf ſeparated from the preſence and glory of God if I knew the man: And wo and alas to me, all this I did when my Lord and Maſter was neer me, yea when he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his trial; yea, and yet more, when all the world had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken him, yea, and yet more, when I had the greateſt and loudeſt call that ever I had to have ſtood by him, and to have given my teſtimony for him! And thus <hi>Peter</hi> caſting up all theſe circumſtances and aggravations together, and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſeriouſly on them, <hi>he went out and wept bitterly.</hi> Another fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous inſtance of this you have in <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 26.10, 11. In theſe two verſes the Apoſtle layes down no leſs than eight ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations of his ſins, and all to greaten and heighten them, that his ſoul might be the more aſhamed and humbled in him, &amp;c.</p>

               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, To caſt a man into priſon for theft, for mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for perjury, is no iniquity; I but ſayes he, many have I caſt into priſon for profeſsing the name of Jeſus of <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</hi> O! 'tis dreadful to perſecute men meerly for profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Chriſt, and yet this I did; though their profeſsion and practiſe went together, though they lived as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, though I had nothing againſt them, but in the matters of their God, yet upon that very ſingle account did I perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them.</p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:52491:143"/>
               <p>Thirdly, If it had been but one, or two, or three, or five, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> or ten Saints that I had perſecuted, the matter had not been much. O, but they were a great number; <hi>many of the Saints did I caſt into priſon.</hi> I have been a cruel ravening wolf, that have ſuckt the bloud not of a few, but of many of the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous lambs of Chriſt; I have neither ſpared nor pitied any ſex, but have broken into every houſe, haling and dragging both men and women to priſon, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.3. <hi>As for</hi> Saul, <hi>he made havock of the Church, entring into every houſe, and haling men and women, committed them to priſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Though he had caſt them into priſon, yet if he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> had given them but ſome liberty in a priſon, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> had,<note place="margin">Act. 9.1, 2.</note> and as others have had, and as himſelf once had when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got <hi>Oneſimus</hi> in his bonds, <hi>Philemon</hi> v. 10. and when <hi>Oneſipho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> oft refreſhed him, and was not aſhamed of his chain, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16, &amp;c. or as the primitive Chriſtians had, the matter had not been ſo great. O, but I kept them cloſs pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners; <hi>Many of the Saints did I ſhut up in priſon.</hi> I ſhut them up from friends, from relations, and from all comfortable accommodations; and thus he further aggravates his ſin.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If he had reſted there, if he had proceeded no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> further, the matter had not been ſo bad; O, <hi>But I gave my voice againſt them to put them to death.</hi> My heart and my hand was not only againſt them, but my tongue alſo; if I could not kill them with my hand, I was ready and willing to kill them with my tongue; if the caſting voice fell upon me, I would be ſure to give it againſt them; I never wanted a word to do them a miſchief; if they wanted a word, inſtead of a knife to cut their throats, I would be ſure to lend them one.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, He riſes yet higher; for he does not only ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> puniſh their bodies, but he does what he can to damn their ſouls; I compelled them to blaſpheme, like that <hi>Italian,</hi> who firſt made his enemy deny God, and then ſtabb'd him, and ſo at once murdered both body and ſoul. As there is no love to ſoul love, ſo there is no cruelty to ſoul cruelty; and as there
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:52491:144"/> is no miſchief to ſoul miſchief, ſo there is no murder to ſoul murder, and yet in this murder had <hi>Paul</hi> a hand. 'Tis ſad to compel a man to bear a burden beyond his ſtrength, to lye in chains, to forſake his own countrey, &amp;c. but 'tis infinitely more ſad, to compel a man to ſin, to the leaſt ſin; but ſaddeſt of all to compel a man to blaſpheme, <hi>And yet this I did,</hi> ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>yes <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventhly, He yet further aggravates his ſin by his mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by his exceeding madneſs againſt the Saints, in thoſe words; <hi>And I was exceedingly mad againſt them.</hi> He was mad with rage and wrath, he was exceedingly mad with paſsion and fury againſt the dear Saints of God; mad men think madly, and mad men ſpeak madly, and mad men act madly againſt thoſe they are mad with; and ſo did he againſt the Saints. The <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſaith, That God created the Angels of light, and the Devils of the flame. Certainly, as God's children are children of the light, ſo Satan's children are fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious children, wrathful children, children of the flame, children of madneſs; and ſuch a one was <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Eighthly and laſtly, <hi>I did perſecute them to ſtrange Cities;</hi> them I did not kill I did ſcatter, I forced them to leave both houſe and home; them whom God had joyned together, I put aſunder; I made the husband run one way, and the wife and children another way, and all of them glad to hide their heads in a corner. And thus you ſee, that true penitents in the confeſsion of their ſins, do cloath their ſins with the higheſt aggravations imaginable. A penitent in his confeſsion of ſin cryes out, O! the ſparing mercies, the preventing mercies, the ſuccouring mercies, the ſupporting mercies, the renewed mercies, the delivering mercies that I have with a high hand ſinned againſt. O, that clear light! O, that free love! O, that Goſpel grace! O, thoſe bowels of mercy that I have ſinned againſt! O, the fatherly corrections, the dreadful warnings, the high reſolutions, the ſerious proteſtations, the frequent vows and promiſes that I have deſperately ſinned againſt!

But now wicked men confeſs their ſins ſlightly, careleſly, trifling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; they are careful and skilful to hide their ſins, to cloak their ſins, and to extenuate and leſſen their ſins; and with the unjuſt Steward, for an hundred to ſet down fifty.<note place="margin">Luke 16.6.</note> All wicked men do commonly flatter themſelves, that either their ſins are not ſins when indeed they are, or that they are not great and grievous ſins when indeed they are, or that they are not ſo great and grievous as other mens ſins are when indeed they are more grievous and hainous than other mens ſins are, ſo far are they from aggravating of their ſins; the truth is, wicked men are ſo far from aggravating of their ſins, that they are ſtill extenuating of them, and that by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of them, ſometimes upon their conſtitutions, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times upon bad company, ſometimes upon their callings, ſometimes upon Satan, and ſometimes upon chance, as they call it, &amp;c.

               <p>Sixthly, The true penitent confeſſes his ſins humbly, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfully. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> In his confeſſions he appears before the Lord with ropes about his neck (as <hi>Benhadad</hi>'s ſervants) and with tears in his eyes; his confeſsions ſavour of contrition of heart, and not of oſtentation of ſpirit; contrition of heart,<note place="margin">Levit. 23.27.28.</note> and confuſion of face, is the common reſult of a penitential con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion. <hi>David</hi> waters his couch with his tears, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 6.6. and he mingles his meat with his tears (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.3.) and <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> confeſs their ſins with wet eyes and bluſhing cheeks. Confeſsion without contrition,<note place="margin">Ezra 9.

The ſpirit of repentance is a
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:52491:145"/> ſpirit of mourning. Penitential confeſsions are commonly attended with grief in the heart,<note place="margin">Compare theſe Scriptures toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Pſal. 51.17. Iſa. 61.1. &amp; 57.15 Job 16.20.

The ſame ſpirit you may find working in <hi>Jacob, Hoſea</hi> 12.4. yea, he had power over the Angel and prevailed, he wept and made ſupplication unto him. The people of God in the day of their confeſsion, do not only ſay we have ſinned, but they alſo draw water and pour it out before the Lord in token of contrition, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.6. Every ſin is as a ſword in a peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent mans boſom, and therefore whilſt confeſsions are in his mouth, you ſhall moſtly find, either tears in his eyes, or ſorrow in his heart. And indeed, true confeſsion of ſin is many times rather a voice of mourning, than a voice of words; ſometimes a penitent man's eyes will in ſome ſort tell what his tongue can in no ſort utter; many times the penitent is better at weeping than he is at ſpeaking, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.12. <hi>Hold not thy peace at my tears.</hi> Tears have a voice (as well as bloud hath) and are very prevalent Orators with God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6.8. <hi>The Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping.</hi> Penitent tears are undeniable Ambaſſadors, and they never return from the throne of grace without an anſwer of grace. Tears are a kind of ſilent prayers, which though they ſay nothing, yet they obtain pardon, they prevail for mercy, and they carry the day with God, as you may ſee in that great and clear inſtance of <hi>Peter;</hi> he ſaid nothing, he confeſt nothing that we read of, but went out and wept bitterly, and obtained mercy. That preſcription that God gave to the Leper in the Law, is worthy of your moſt ſerious conſideration; 'tis in that, <hi>Levit.</hi> 13.45. <hi>And the Leper in whom the plague is, his cloaths ſhall be rent, and his bead bare, and he ſhall put a covering upon his upper lip, and ſhall cry, unclean, unclean.</hi> In theſe words the Leper ſtands charged with four things; 1. To go in rent or torn garments, to note that there muſt be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs and ſorrow of heart joyned with confeſsion of ſin. 2. To go bare-headed, and that partly that men might not miſtake him, but mainly to ſhew his humility under his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:52491:145"/> miſery. 3. To put a covering upon his upper lip. (Some read it, upon his <hi>Mouchaches</hi>) The <hi>Jews</hi> in their mournings uſed this Ceremony among the reſt, of covering their chin, mouth, <hi>Mouchaches,</hi> all under the noſe. Now the uſe of this Ceremony in the Leper, was partly to preſerve others from being infected by his loathſom breath, and partly to ſhew that God takes no pleaſure nor delight in the breathings, the prayers of ſpiritual Lepers, of wicked men. God loves not to hear good words drop from an ill mouth, and partly to note that ſhame that muſt be mingled with his ſorrow. 4. Twice to proclaim his own uncleanneſs, <hi>unclean, unclean.</hi> And thus you ſee that there was to be a cloſs connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Lepers confeſsion and his contrition; and thus 'tis with the true penitent; he does not only cry out, unclean, unclean, but he alſo rents and tears his garments, that is, he joyns contrition to his confeſsion.</p>
               <p>But to prevent miſtakes, and that I may not ſhoot an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, inſtead of giving a cordial, to the weak and weary ſoul; let me only give you this ſhort hint, <hi>viz.</hi> That when the true penitent can't pour out his ſoul in heart-melting confeſsions before the Lord, yet then he can mourn over his own hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart; when he is at worſt he can grieve that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not grieve, and mourn that he cannot mourn, and melt that he cannot melt, and break that he cannot break; and he can bleſs God for every rod, and every ſtroak, and every word, and every work, and every Ordinance, and every frown, and every reproof, and every croſs, and every comfort, that has the leaſt tendency to the melting and mollifying of his ſoul. The true penitent alwayes ſets a very high price and value upon a broken heart, though he has not the happineſs alwayes to have his heart broken. I know that ſometimes the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſoul is ſo ſhut up, that if he might have all the world he cannot mourn, he can only ſit down, and ſigh, and groan; nay, if all the joys and delights of heaven were to be bought for one ſingle tear, he can't ſhed it; and yet all this time he can grieve that he cannot grieve for ſin, and he can be ſorry
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:52491:146"/> that he cannot be ſorry for ſin; and without all peradventure this is in a meaſure true godly Goſpel-ſorrow for ſin, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But now wicked men confeſs their ſins, but they never grieve for their ſins; they confeſs their ſins, but they are not aſhamed of their ſins,<note place="margin">Compare theſe Scriptures toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Jer. 6.15. &amp; 8.12.

Though men of good names, and of good natures, would be aſhamed to be found doing of baſe things, things that are below them, that are not worthy of them, yet the generality of ſinners are ſo bold and baſe, ſo ignorant, arrogant and impudent, ſo frontleſs and graceleſs, &amp;c. that they are no wayes aſhamed, no not of thoſe very ſins that has put Chriſt to an open ſhame; yea, that has put the Sun and Moon to a bluſh. Moſt ſinners in theſe dayes have brows of braſs, and whores foreheads that cannot bluſh; they are ſo far from being aſhamed of their ſins, that they think it a ſhame and diſgrace not to ſin, not to ſwear, and whore, and curſe, and be drunk, and prophane Sabbaths, and diſpiſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; yea, there are many that are ſo far from being aſhamed of their abominations, that they even glory in them, like thoſe in that, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19. They ſhew their ſins as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> they make both a ſport of acting, and a jeſt of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing their ſins. Thus <hi>Auſtin</hi> confeſſeth that it was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with himſelf, before the Lord wrought upon him; I was ſtricken with ſuch blindneſs, as that I thought it a ſhame unto me to be leſs vile and wicked than my companions whom I heard boaſt of their leudneſs, and glory ſo much the more, by how much they were the more filthy; therefore (ſaith he) leſt I ſhould be of no account, I was the more vicious; and when I could not otherwiſe match others, I would feign that I had done thoſe things which I never did, leſt I ſhould ſeem ſo much the more abject, by how much I was the more innocent; and ſo much the more vile, by how much I was the more chaſt. But for a cloſe remember this, The true penitent knows, that the more God has been diſpleaſed with the blackneſs of ſin, the better he will be pleaſed with the bluſhing of the ſinner; and therefore he can't but bluſh when either he looks upon ſin within him, or God above him. But,</p>

The true
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:52491:149"/> penitent turns from ſin with his heart, with all his heart, and with all his ſoul; he is turned in good earneſt from his ſins, whoſe heart is turned from his ſins; if the heart turns not, all is naught, all is ſtark naught; he that turns from ſin, but not with his heart, turns but feignedly, partially, hypocritical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, deceifully. God is a juſt and a jealous God, and he will never endure corrivals or copartners in the throne, the heart of man; a holy God will never divide with an unholy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. The true God is a righteous God, and he will never ſhare his glory with another; the true God muſt be ſerved truly, heartily, he loves neither halting nor halving.

<pb n="258" facs="tcp:52491:150"/> ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not die.</hi> True repentance is a turning from all ſin, without any reſervation or exception; he never truly repented of any ſin, whoſe heart is not turned againſt every ſin. The true penitent caſts off all the rags of old <hi>Adam,</hi> he throws down every ſtone of the old building, he will not leave a horn nor a hoof behind. That which <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf in that, <hi>Neh.</hi> 13.7, 8. is very obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our purpoſe. <hi>And I came to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>and underſtood of the evil that</hi> Eliaſhib <hi>did for</hi> Tobiah, <hi>in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the houſe of God, and it grieved me ſore</hi> (but he reſts not there, but goes further) <hi>therefore I caſt forth all the houſhold-ſtuff of</hi> Tobiah <hi>out of the chamber.</hi> What ſhould <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biah</hi> do with a chamber? therefore he not only outs <hi>Tobiah,</hi> but outgoes all his ſtuff too. Thus the true penitent, when he conſiders all the evil that ſin has done, how it has taken up not only one chamber, but every chamber in the ſoul, and how it has for many years quite ſhut out God, and Chriſt, and the Spirit, and every thing that is good; he is grieved ſore, and ſo falls upon the outging of every luſt, being highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that neither Satan nor any of his retinue ſhall ever find the leaſt entertainment in his ſoul any more. Such as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved againſt turning from any ſin, are horrible profane; ſuch as turn from ſome ſins, but cloſe with others, are hideous hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites; ſuch as turn from one ſin to another, or change their ſins as men do their faſhions, are moſt ſadly blinded, and deſperately deluded by Satan; but ſuch as turn not from ſome ſins, but from every ſin, are ſincerely penitent. And certainly there are very grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> reaſons why the true penitent does turn, and muſt turn from ſin univerſally. As,</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, 'Tis to no purpoſe for a man to turn from ſome ſins, if he does not turn from all his ſins, <hi>James</hi> 1.26. <hi>If any man ſeem to be religious and bridle not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this mans Religion is in vain.</hi> This at firſt ſight may ſeem to be a hard ſaying,<note place="margin">One ſtab at the heart kills, one act of treaſon makes a Traitor, one ſpark of fire ſets the houſe on fire, one flaw in a diamond ſpoyls the price of it, one puddle if we wallow in it, will defile us, one head of garlick will poyſon a Leopard, ſay the Naturaliſts.</note> that for one fault, for one fault in the tongue, all a mans Religion ſhould be counted vain, and yet this you ſee the holy Ghoſt does peremptorily conclude. Let a man make never ſo glorious a profeſſion of Religion, yet if he gives himſelf liberty to live in the practiſe of any
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:52491:150"/> known luſt, yea though it be but in a ſin of the tongue, his Religion is in vain, and that one luſt will ſeparate him from God for ever. If a Wife be never ſo officious to her Husband in many things, and though ſhe gives him content ſeveral wayes, yet if ſhe entertains any other Lover into his bed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides himſelf, it will alienate his affections from her, and for ever ſeparate him from her. The application is eaſie. To turn from one ſin to another, is but to be toſſed from one hand of the Devil to another; it is but with <hi>Benhadad,</hi> to recover of one diſeaſe and die of another, it is but to take pains to go to hell. If a Ship ſpring three leaks, and only two be ſtopped, the third will ſink the Ship; or if a man have two grievous wounds in his body, and take order only to cure one, that which is neglected will certainly kill him: 'Tis ſo here, if a man that has divers luſts fighting againſt the life of his preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſoul, ſhall only mortifie and ſlay ſome of them, the reſt will certainly deſtroy him, and all his pains in ſubduing ſome of them will be loſt. I have read of a devout man, who had amongſt many other vertues, the gift of healing, unto whom divers made reſort for cure; among the reſt, one <hi>Chromatius</hi> being ſick ſent for him, being come he told him of his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and deſired that he might have the benefit of cure as others had before him: I cannot do it (ſaid the devout per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) till thou haſt beaten all the Idols and Images in thy houſe to pieces. O, that ſhall be done, ſaid <hi>Chromatius,</hi> here take my keys, and where you find any Images let them be defaced, which was done accordingly; to prayer went the holy man, but no cure was wrought. O, ſaith <hi>Chromatius,</hi> I am as ſick as ever, O, I am very weak and ſick: It cannot be otherwiſe, replyed the holy man, nor can I help it; for certainly there is one Idol more in your houſe undiſcovered, and that muſt be defaced too. True, ſayes <hi>Chromatius,</hi> there is ſo indeed, there is one all of beaten gold, it coſt 200 <hi>l.</hi> I would fain have ſaved it; but here take my keys again, you ſhall find it locked up faſt in my cheſt, take it and break it in pieces; which done, the holy man prayed, and <hi>Chromatius</hi> was healed. The moral of this ſtory is this: We are all ſpiritually ſick, full of wounds and putrified ſores; Chriſt our ſpiritual Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:52491:151"/> tells us, that if we will be cured, we muſt break off our ſins by repentance. Now this we are willing to do in part, but not in whole; we would fain keep one <hi>Dalilah,</hi> one darling beloved ſin, but it muſt not be, there muſt not be one ſin unrepented of; we muſt repent as well for our <hi>Achans</hi> as our <hi>Abſaloms,</hi> our <hi>Rimmons</hi> as our <hi>Mammons,</hi> our <hi>Davids</hi> as our <hi>Goliahs,</hi> our covert as well as our open ſins, our loved as well as our loathed luſts, our heart abominations as well as our groſs tranſgreſſions, our Babe iniquities as well as our Giant-like provocations; our repentance muſt be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, or 'twill be to no purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Herod</hi> turned from many evils, but would not turn from his <hi>Herodias,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mark 6.18, 19, 20</note> and that was his ruin. <hi>Judas</hi> his life was as fair and as free from ſpots and blots, as the lives of any of the Apoſtles, no ſcandalous ſin was to be found upon him, only that golden Devil covetouſneſs was his ſin, and his everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ruin; his Apoſtleſhip, Preaching, working of Miracles, hearing of Chriſt, and converſing with him, &amp;c. was to no purpoſe, becauſe of that Serpent he kept in his boſom, which at laſt ſtung him to death. If a man lives in the practiſe of any known ſin, the union between ſin and his ſoul is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved; and if that union be not diſſolved, Chriſt and his ſoul was never united, and therefore ſuch a perſon can never be ſaved. <hi>Saul</hi> ſpared <hi>Agag</hi> and the Witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> whom he ſhould have deſtroyed, and ſo loſt his Crown, his Kingdom, and his Soul, which was ſaddeſt of all. <hi>Gideon</hi> had ſeventy ſons,<note place="margin">Judg. 8.13.</note> and but one baſtard, and yet that one baſtard deſtroyed all the reſt.

                     <pb n="261" facs="tcp:52491:151"/> Chap. 2.10. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law,</hi>

He that gives himſelf liberty to live in the breach of any one command of God, is qualified with a diſpoſition of heart to break them all; every ſingle ſin contains virtually all ſin in it. He that allows himſelf a liberty to live in the breach of any one particular Law of God, he caſts contempt and ſcorn upon the authority that made the whole Law, and upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count breaks it all. And the Apoſtle gives the reaſon of it in Verſe 11. <hi>For he that ſaid, do not commit adultery, ſaid alſo, do not kill; now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a tranſgreſſor of the Law.</hi> Not that he is guilty of all diſtributively, but collectively; for the Law is copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, there is a chain of duties, and theſe are all ſo linked one to another, that you cannot break one link of the chain, but you break the whole chain. All the precepts of the Law are as it were a ſtring of pearls ſtrung by the authority of God; now break this ſtring in any place, and all the pearls fall to the ground. No man can live in the breach of any known command of God, but he wrongs every command of God; and this at laſt he ſhall find to his coſt, without ſound repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance on his ſide, and pardoning grace on God's.

And thus ſaith that old Father by denying God in the Fly, he came to deny God in Man; and ſo conſequently the whole Creation. And thus yielding to leſſer ſins, draws the ſoul to the comm ſſion of greater, yea often to the greateſt of all. I have both heard and read a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a young man, who being often tempted by the Devil and his own wicked heart, to commit three ſins, <hi>viz.</hi> to kill his father, to lye with his mother, and to be drunk; the two former his heart would not yield to, as being things abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to the light and law of nature, and therefore to free himſelf from the temptation, he yielded to the laſt and leaſt; but when he was drunk, he killed his father and raviſhed his mother: Thus theſe two abominable ſins, Murder and Inceſt were uſhered in by one that was not of ſo deep a dye. There is ſomething in ſin, like the radical vertue that is in the ſeed of Herbs and Plants; the ſeed is but a ſmall inconſiderable thing in it ſelf, yet let it be but caſt into the ground, and there reſt quietly a time, and it will take root, and grow up to a great ſtock, and bring forth many flouriſhing branches, like the grain of muſtard-ſeed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.31, 32. which though it be the leaſt of ſeeds, yet being caſt into the ground, grows up to be the greateſt among herbs, and becometh a Tree, ſo that the birds of the Air come and lodge in the branches thereof. Satan will be ſure to neſt himſelf, to lodge himſelf in the leaſt ſins (as birdsneſt and lodge themſelves in the ſmalleſt branches of a Tree) and there he will hatch all
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:52491:152"/> manner of wickedneſs. A ſinful motion, if it be not reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will procure conſent, and conſent will break forth into act, and one act will procure another act, until the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of acts have begot a habit, and that habit hath choakt and ſtifled conſcience, and when once conſcience is ſtifled and benummed, it will be ready upon all occaſions to lay the ſoul open, and to proſtrate it to the baſeſt and worſt of ſins. O! there is a prodigious evil in the leaſt of ſins, it will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly multiply it ſelf into all manner of evils; unleſs ſin be cut off in the firſt motion, it will proceed to action, and from action to delectation, and from delight to cuſtom, and from cuſtom to a habit; and ſo the ſoul will be in eminent danger of being undone for ever. A little thief put in at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, may open the doors for ſtronger and greater to come in, that may take away both life and treaſure at once. A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wedge makes way for a greater, and ſo do little ſins make way for greater.

Look, as <hi>Abſalom's</hi> beauty was ſpread all over him,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 24.25.</note> even from the crown of his head to the ſoals of his feet; ſo grace ſpreads it ſelf over every faculty of the ſoul, and over every member of the body. Look, as <hi>Solomon's</hi> Temple was all glorious both within and without; ſo that grace which a man receives at firſt converſion, makes him all glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious both within and without.<note place="margin">John 1.16.</note> Look, as <hi>Adam's</hi> ſin ſpread it ſelf over the whole man, ſo that grace which we receive from the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> ſpreads it ſelf over the whole man.

Now, look as heaven is contrary to all of hell, and as light is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all darkneſs, and heat to all cold; ſo that divine, that noble, that univerſal principle of grace, which God at firſt converſion infuſes into the penitents ſoul, is contrary to all ſin; and therefore the penitent turns from all ſin. But,</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventhly, The true penitent would have God to forgive him, not only ſome of his ſins, but all his ſins; and therefore 'tis but juſt and equal that he ſhould turn from all his ſins. If God be ſo faithful and juſt to forgive us all our ſins,<note place="margin">1 John 1.9.</note> we muſt be ſo faithful and juſt as to turn from all our ſins. The plaiſter muſt be as broad as the ſore, and the tent as long and as deep as the wound. It argues horrid hypocriſie, damnable folly, and wonderful impudency, for a man to beg the pardon of
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:52491:154"/> thoſe very ſins that he is reſolved never to forſake. Look, as he that hath any one ſin forgiven, hath all ſins forgiven; ſo he that hath ſincerely turned from any one ſin, he hath turned from every ſin; and he that hath not repented him of all known ſin, he hath not yet ſincerely repented of any known ſin, nor as yet experienced the ſweetneſs of forgiveneſs of ſin. He that will not renounce thoſe ſins that he would have God to remit, ſhall be ſure to have a hell (of guilt) in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Of all fools there is none to him, that is very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate with God to forgive thoſe ſins, which he is reſolved before-hand to commit; for what Prince (in his wits) will pardon his treaſons that is reſolved to continue a Traitor? or what Judge will forgive his thievery, that is peremptorily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to continue a thief? or what Husband will pardon his Wife that is reſolved to defile his bed with other Lovers? Such as continue in the practiſe of thoſe very ſins, which they beg a pardon of, ſhall certainly go without their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. Pardon of ſin is for that man, and that man is for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin, that is as truly willing to forſake his ſins as he is to receive the pardon of his ſins. Who would not look upon that man as a mad man, who ſhould earneſtly beg his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and yet before his pardon is ſealed, ſhould afreſh cut purſes, and murder perſons before the eyes of the Judge? The pardoned ſoul is the repenting ſoul, and the repenting ſoul is the pardoned ſoul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.2. <hi>Bleſſed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whoſe ſpirit there is no guil.</hi> He that begs pardon of ſin, and is reſolved againſt turning from ſin, ſhall find no more ſweetneſs in that grand promiſe of pardon, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. than devils or damned ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits do. Look as one ſin unforgiven, will as certainly undo and damn a man as a thouſand; ſo one ſin unforſaken, will as certainly undo and damn a man as a thouſand. The true pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent is as willing to turn from all his ſins, as he is willing that God ſhould pardon all his ſins. But,</p>
                  <p>Eighthly and laſtly, There is in every penitent a ſincere <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> hatred of ſin, a univerſal hatred of ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.10. <hi>Ye that love the Lord hate evil.</hi> Prov. 8.13. <hi>The fear of the Lord is to

Holy hatred is an implacable and an irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable affection; you ſhall as ſoon reconcile God and Satan together, Chriſt and Antichriſt together, heaven and hell together, as you ſhall be able to reconcile a penitent ſoul and his ſin together. A true penitent looks upon every ſin as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Law of God, the nature of God, the being of God, the glory of God, and accordingly his heart riſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; he looks upon every ſin as poyſon, as the vomit of a dog, as the mire of the ſtreet, as the<note n="*" place="margin">

The penitent ſoul will do all he can to be the death of every ſin that has had a hand in the death of his Lord and Maſter; he looks upon the ſins of his body, to be the tormentors of Chriſt's body, and the ſins of his ſoul, to be the tormentors of Chriſt's ſoul, to be thoſe that made his ſoul heavy to the death, and that cauſed the withdrawings of his father's love from him, and that forced him in the anguiſh of his ſoul to cry out,<note place="margin">Mat. 27.46.</note>

God's fatherly indulgence accepts of the will for the work, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. As a father will accept in his child the deſire for the deed, and if there be a blemiſh in his child, he will pity it, and caſt a mantle of love over it.

True repentance takes an everlaſting farewel, an everlaſting adieu of ſin; it ſaith with the Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.3. I have put off my coat, how ſhall I put it on? I have found the ſmart of ſin, I have put off the garments of the old man, the rags of old <hi>Adam,</hi> and how ſhall I put them on again? The burnt child will dread the fire. The man that hath ſmarted for Suretyſhip, will by no means be perſwaded to come again into bonds, though you urge him to it never ſo frequently, never ſo ſtrongly, never ſo rhetorically, yet he will tell you he has ſmarted for it, he has paid dear for it, and therefore you muſt excuſe him; he is peremptorily reſolved, nay he hath ſeriouſly vowed againſt it; and though he be never ſo much intreated, and by varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of arguments importuned, yet ſtill he remains inexorable. A Chriſtian that hath truly repented, is ſo ſenſible of the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſweetneſs of the grace of God on the one hand, and of the weight of ſin and wrath of God on the other hand, that he is highly reſolved never to have any more to do with Idols,<note place="margin">Pſal. 40.12. Hoſ. 14.8.</note> never to meddle more with thoſe burning coals. True repentance is a continued act, a repentance never to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of. The true penitent is every day a turning further and further from ſin, and neerer and neerer to God. There is nothing that fetches ſo many tears from a penitent man's eyes, nor ſo many ſighs and groans from a penitent man's heart as this, that he can get no further off from ſin, and that he can get no neerer nor no cloſſer to God. Repentance for ſin, and a willing continuance in ſin, cannot conſiſt in the ſame ſubject. A ſincere penitent makes as much conſcience of repenting daily, as he doth of believing daily, and he can as eaſily content himſelf with one act of faith, or love, or
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:52491:158" rendition="simple:additions"/> fear, or hope, or joy, or obedience, as he can content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with one act of repentance. <hi>My ſins are ever before me.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 51.3.</note> This is the voice of every true penitent; Oh, that I might ſin no more! Oh, that I might never diſhonour God more! Oh, that I might never walk contrary to Jeſus Chriſt more! Oh, that I might never grieve the ſpirit of grace more. To ſin is common to man,<note place="margin">1 John 1.8, 10. &amp; 5.19. Iſa. 28.15, 18. Pſal. 139.24. Rom. 7.22, 23.</note> yea to the beſt man in all the world, but to continue in a courſe of ſin, is only proper to a wicked man. To err and fail that's humane, but to maintain a league or friendſhip with ſin, that is diabolical. Though a true penitent dares not continue in a trade, a path of ſin, whilſt he lives in this world, yet ſin will continue in him whilſt he continues in this world; though ſin and grace were not born together, and though ſin and grace ſhall never die together, yet whilſt a penitent man lives in this world they muſt live together. 'Tis one thing for ſin to continue in us, and 'tis another thing for us to continue in ſin. The Apoſtle having cloſed the fifth Chapter of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> in the triumph of Goſpel grace; That <hi>as ſin hath reigned unto death, ſo grace might reign through righteouſneſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <note place="margin">Rom. 6.1, 2.</note> begins the next with a prevention of the abuſe of this grace; <hi>What ſhall we ſay then? ſhall we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in ſin that grace may abound? God forbid. How ſhall we that are dead to ſin, live any longer therein?</hi> To live in ſin, in the face of Goſpel-grace is moſt unreaſonable, and to a gracious and ingenious nature impoſſible; the very queſtion implyes a kind of impoſſibility. Such as were once dead in ſin, and now by Goſpel-grace are dead to ſin, ſuch can no longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in ſin. Look, as 'tis not the meer falling into the water that drowns a man, but his lying and continuing in it; ſo it is not a meer falling into ſin that damns a man, that drowns a man, that everlaſtingly undoes a man, but his living in it, his continuing in it. It is bad to ſin, but 'tis infinitely worſe to continue in ſin. The firſt beſt is not to ſin, the next beſt is not to continue in ſin, no not for an hour, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe (<hi>Gal.</hi> 2.5.) <hi>To whom we gave place by ſubjection, no not for an hour.</hi> Certainly to argue from Goſpel-mercy to ſinful liberty, is the Devil's Logick. The more a man lives in the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:52491:159"/> ſight of Goſpel-grace, the more ſin will be diſcountenanced, reſiſted, hated, and totally diſplaced. A man may as truly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, that the Sea burns, or that the fire cools, or that the Sun darkens the Air, as he may aſſert that the ſight, ſenſe, or ſweet of Goſpel-grace will breed ſecurity or carnality, looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or wickedneſs, in a gracious heart. The true penitent never ceaſes repenting, till he ceaſes living; he goes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with the joyful tears of repentance in his eyes; he knows that his whole life is but a day of ſowing tears, that he may at laſt reap everlaſting joyes. True repentance makes a final and everlaſting ſeparation between ſin and the ſoul; it makes ſuch an abſolute and compleat divorce between ſin and the ſoul, and caſts them ſo far aſunder, that no power nor poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy can ever bring them to meet as lovers together. The true penitent looks upon ſin as an enemy, and deals with it, as <hi>Amnon</hi> dealt with <hi>Tamar,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.15. <hi>And</hi> Amnon <hi>hated her exceedingly, ſo that the hatred wherewith he hated her, was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her; and</hi> Amnon <hi>ſaid unto her, ariſe, be gone.</hi> And juſt thus doth the penitent ſoul carry it towards ſin. He that truly repents, ſo turns from his ſins, that he never returns to the bondage and ſervice of his ſins any more,<note place="margin">Iſa. 1.16. Pſal. 85.8.</note> 
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.22. <hi>Ye ſhall defile alſo the covering of thy graven images of ſilver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold; thou ſhalt caſt them away as a menſtrous cloth; thou ſhalt ſay unto it, Get thee hence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now the repentance of hypocrites is not conſtant but inconſtant, 'tis not ſtedfaſt but unſtedfaſt, 'tis not permanent but tranſient, 'tis quickly on, as quickly off; <hi>Come,</hi> ſay they, in that, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 6.1. <hi>and let us return unto the Lord.</hi> But <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>O</hi> Ephraim! <hi>what ſhall I do unto thee?

An hypocrites repentance ſprings from mutable grounds, cauſes, conſiderations and circumſtances; and therefore it is compared to a deceitful bow, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 7.16. 'tis as variable as the wind.

An hypocrite puts off his ſins in the day of adverſity (as he doth his garments when he goes to bed) with an intent to put them on again in the morning of profperity, <hi>Ver.</hi> 34, 35, 36. <hi>When he ſlew them then they ſought him, and they returned and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired early after God; and they remembred that God was their Rock, and the high God their Redeemer: Nevertheleſs they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lyed unto him with their tongues.</hi> In the language of the bleſſed Scripture, he is a dog that returns to his vomit again, and ſuch a dog was <hi>Judas;</hi> and he is a ſwine that returns to the wallowing in the mire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and ſuch a ſwine was <hi>Demas;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.20, 21, 22.</note> and ſuch dogs and ſwine are all hypocrites. It is an extraordinary vanity in ſome men to lay aſide their ſins for a time, but with a purpoſe to return to them again; as they fable it of the Serpent that layeth aſide his poyſon when he goeth to drink, and when he hath drank, he returns to it again. It is a ſad and ſore evil, when men ſay to their luſts, as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid to his ſervants, <hi>Abide you here, and I will go and worſhip, and return again unto you,</hi> Gen. 22.5. doubtleſs ſuch ſouls are as far off from ſound repentance, as light is from darkneſs, or as hell is from heaven, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Negatively, It is not ſuch a turning from ſin as never to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſin more, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.46. <hi>For there is no man that ſinneth not.</hi> Prov. 20.9. <hi>Who can ſay, I have made my heart clean?

Such is the univerſal corruption of humane nature, that the ſouls of the beſt, of the pureſt, and of the holieſt men in the world, do from day to day, yea from moment to moment, contract ſome filth and uncleanneſs. The choiceſt Saints can never acquit themſelves from ſins of infirmity, ſuch as do inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and inſeparably cleave unto the beſt of men, eſpecially conſidering the ſtate and condition wherein they are, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill about them corrupt fleſh and bloud. <hi>Methodius</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the inbred corruptions of man's heart to a wild Fig-tree, growing upon the wall of ſome goodly Temple or ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Palace, whereof although the main trunk of the ſtem be broke off, and ſtump of the root be plucked up, yet the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brous ſtrings of it piercing into the joynts of the ſtone work, will not be utterly extracted, but will be ever and anon ſhooting and ſprouting out, until the whole frame of the building be diſſolved, and the ſtone work thereof be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynted and pulled in pieces.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, It is not ſuch a turning from ſin, as that the true penitent ſhall never relapſe into the ſame kind of ſin any more; for a true penitent may fall into the ſame ſin again and again. It was a ſin for the diſciples to ſleep when Chriſt had commanded them to watch and pray,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45.</note> and yet they ſlept again and again. The prophet <hi>Jonah</hi> was a holy man, and
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:52491:160"/> yet he relapſed into paſſion and diſcontent with God again and again; he was diſcontent with the work God ſet him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, therefore he flieth to <hi>Tarſhiſh,</hi> Jonah 1.2, 3. and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows for it, and confeſſeth that they that truſt upon lying vanities forſake their own mercies, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.8. and yet when God had ſhewed mercy to <hi>Niniveh,</hi> he was exceedingly diſcontented with God again, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4.1. <hi>But it diſpleaſed</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah <hi>exceedingly, and he was very angry.</hi> And when the Lord, who might have ſent him to his grave, or a frown'd him to hell, reaſons lovingly, ſweetly and mildly with him to take him off from his paſſion, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.3, 4. and provides for him in his extremity; yet upon a very ſmall occaſion, <hi>viz.</hi> the taking away of a Gourd or ſhrub (which God did to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him of his folly and waſpiſhneſs of ſpirit) he breaks out again into the ſame paſſion, or worſe, as if he had never ſeen the evil of it, or been humbled for it, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4.8, 9. <hi>I am greatly angry,</hi> or I do well to be angry, <hi>even unto death.</hi> And that is very conſiderable that <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks concerning his friends, <hi>Job</hi> 19.3. <hi>Theſe ten times have ye reproached me, yet are ye not aſhamed.</hi> It is a ſin to reproach any man, it is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to reproach a godly man; but yet greater to reproach a godly man under ſad and ſore afflictions; but yet greateſt of all to reproach a godly man under his ſufferings, often, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently; yet ſaith <hi>Job, Theſe ten times have ye reproached me;</hi> and yet <hi>Job's</hi> friends were not only godly, but eminently godly. By this ſad inſtance 'tis evident, that gracious men, yea that men eminently gracious, may fall into the ſame ſin again and again, yea ten times, that is often. Though Chriſt told his diſciples that his kingdom was not of this world,<note place="margin">John 18.36. Mat. 18.1, 2, 3, 4. Mark 9 34. Luke 9.46. &amp; 22.24, 26.</note> yet at three ſeveral times their pride and ambitious humour put them upon ſtriving for preheminence and worldly greatneſs. King <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> though he was a godly man, yet he joyns affinity with that non ſuch wicked <hi>Ahab,</hi> for which he was ſmartly reproved by the Prophet, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.2. <hi>And</hi> Jehu <hi>went out to meet him, and ſaid to King</hi> Jehoſhaphat, <hi>ſhouldeſt thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the Lord? therefore is wrath upon thee from the Lord.</hi> Now though this gracious Prince was thus reproved and ſaved, even by a miracle of mercy,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:52491:161" rendition="simple:additions"/> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18.1, 2, 3, 30, 31. compared; yet ſoon after he falls into the ſame ſin again, and joyns himſelf with <hi>Ahaziah</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who did very wickedly, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.35, 36. and for which he is ſeverely reproved in verſe 37. <hi>Then</hi> Elie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer <hi>the ſon of</hi> Dodavan <hi>of</hi> Mareſhah, <hi>propheſied againſt</hi> Jehoſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat, <hi>ſaying, becauſe thou haſt joyned thy ſelf with</hi> Ahaziah, <hi>the Lord hath broken thy works,</hi> and the Ships were broken that they were not able to go to <hi>Tarſhiſh.

Gal. 2.11, 12, 13</note> 13. compared with Chap. 20, 1, 2, 3, 4, 13. <hi>Peter</hi> falls once and again into the ſame ſin, and <hi>John</hi> twice worſhipped the Angel, and <hi>Sampſon</hi> (who is by the Spirit of the Lord numbred amongſt thoſe Worthies of whom this world was not worthy, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.32, 33, 38.) fell again and again into the ſame groſs ſin, as is evident in the 14, 15, &amp; 16. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the book of <hi>Judges.</hi> And the Church confeſſes, that their backſlidings are many, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.7. By all which 'tis moſt evident, that good men may fall again and again into the ſame ſin; and no wonder, for though their repentance be never ſo ſincere and ſound, yet their graces are but weak, and their mortification but imperfect in this life, and therefore 'tis poſſible for a gracious ſoul to fall again and again into the ſame ſin; if the fire be not wholly put out, who will think it impoſſible, that it ſhould catch and burn again and again?</p>
                  <p>I readily grant, that the Lord hath graciouſly promiſed to heal the backſlidings of his people <hi>(Hoſea</hi> 14.4. and ſo <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.22.<note place="margin">See Jer. 3.1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14.</note>

I cannot find in all the book of God, where God has engaged himſelf to give ſuch ſtrength or power againſt this ſin or that, as that a Chriſtian ſhall be for ever (in this life) put out of all poſſibility of falling again and again into the ſame ſins.
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:52491:161" rendition="simple:additions"/> No perſon on earth can ſhew ſuch a promiſe, that when a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian has been thus or thus troubled, grieved, humbled or melted for his ſins, that then God will aſſuredly preſerve him from ever falling into the ſame ſins again. The ſight of ſuch a promiſe under God's own hand, would be as life from the dead to all real Chriſtians, who fear nothing more than the ſin of backſliding. Certainly, there is no ſuch power or infinite vertue in the greateſt horrors or terrors, troubles or ſorrows that the ſoul can be under for ſin, nor in the fulleſt, ſweeteſt or choiceſt diſcoveries of God's rich grace and free love to the ſoul, as for ever to fence and ſecure the ſoul from relapſing into the ſame ſin again and again. Though grace be a glorious creature, yet 'tis but a creature; grace is but a created habit, that may be prevailed againſt by Satans temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and by the ſtrong, ſecret, and ſubtile workings of ſin in our hearts. But this muſt be carefully minded and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, that though the Saints may and do ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe, yet they do not relapſe in ſuch a manner as wicked men do relapſe. For,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They do not relapſe voluntarily, but involuntarily. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Involuntary relapſes, are when the reſolution and full bent of the heart is againſt ſin, when the ſoul ſtrives with all its might againſt ſin, by ſighs and groans, by prayers and tears, and yet by ſome invincible weakneſs is forced to fall back into ſin again, becauſe there is not ſpiritual ſtrength enough to overcome.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They do not relapſe out of choice, as wicked <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> men do, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.3.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They don't relapſe out of any delight that they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> take in relapſing; witneſs their ſad complaints, their great lamentations, and their bitter mournings over their relapſes. Relapſes into diſeaſes, and relapſes into ſins, are more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom and dangerous than they are any wayes delightful, to all that are in their wits.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, They don't relapſe out of any ſetled purpoſe or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> reſolution of heart to relapſe, as wicked men do, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.25. All the relapſes of a Saint, are againſt the ſetled bent, byaſs and reſolution of his ſoul.</p>

                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, They don't relapſe into enormities, as wicked men do (for 'tis not uſual with God to leave his people fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to relapſe into enormities; for by his ſpirit and grace, by his ſmiles and frowns, by his word and rod he doth commonly preſerve his people from a common, a frequent relapſing into enormities, into groſs wickedneſſes.) The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ordinary relapſes of the people of God, are relap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes into infirmities, as idle words, paſſion, haſtineſs, raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, vain thoughts, &amp;c. and theſe God pardons in courſe; but the common and ordinary relapſes of wicked men, are relapſes into enormities, into groſs impieties.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventhly, They don't relapſe habitually, conſtantly, as wicked men do; their relapſes are tranſient, not perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, they are not of courſe. A Sheep may fall into the mire, but a ſwine wallows in the mire, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, I anſwer affirmatively, That notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, yet a true penitential turning from ſin, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued and ſtedfaſt turning from ſin, and that in theſe five re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, In reſpect of his habitual purpoſe and reſolution, not to ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.1. <hi>I ſaid I will take heed to my wayes, that I ſin not with my tongue; I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, In reſpect of his babitual deſires, which are, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that he may not ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.133. <hi>Order my ſteps in thy word, and let not any iniquity have dominion over me. David's</hi> great deſire is that he may walk as in a frame, that he may walk by line and rule, exactly, accurately; and that though ſin did dwell in him, that yet it might not reign in him; and though it did rebel in him, that yet it might not have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over him; he would have his ſins to be like thoſe beaſts in <hi>Daniel,</hi> whoſe dominion was taken away, though their lives were prolonged for a ſeaſon and a time, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.10. <hi>O, let me not wander from thy commandements.</hi> Ver. 36. <hi>Incline my heart unto thy teſtimonies, and not to covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi> Under the name of covetouſneſs, all manner of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs is to be underſtood, that being the root of all evil, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In reſpect of his habitual endeavours, which ſtill <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> are not to ſin. The ordinary and habitual endeavours of a true penitent, are ſtill ſet againſt ſin; he ordinarily rows againſt the ſtream of ſin, though ſometimes the ſtream proves too ſtrong for him. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.11. <hi>Thy word have I hid in my heart, that I might not ſin againſt thee.</hi> He hides the word in his heart as a treaſure, that he might not loſe it, and as a rule, that he might not tranſgreſs againſt it. The Law of God kept cloſs in the heart, is the beſt armour of proof againſt evil luſts. <hi>David</hi> locks up the Law of God in his heart, as in a cheſt or cabinet, to ſecure him againſt Satan's ambuſhes and aſſaults on the one hand, and to preſerve him from ſin on the other hand. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.23. <hi>I have kept my ſelf from mine iniquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, In reſpect of his habitual hatred of ſin. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the true penitent does ſometimes ſin, yet he alwayes hates the evil he does; there is a firm and fixed hatred in his ſoul againſt ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Some ſin or other alwayes reigns without controul, in an hypocritical heart. As they ſay of Witches, that they have one familiar or another that ſtill ſucks them. An Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite alwayes reſerves one neſt-egg or another in his heart or life, for Satan to ſit and brood on. <hi>Jehu</hi> did many brave things, but yet he kept up the worſhip of his golden calves. <hi>Naaman</hi> promiſes high, but yet he is for bowing in the houſe of <hi>Rimmon.</hi> The Phariſees were very devout, but yet they loved the praiſes of men, and the uppermoſt ſeats in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues. There is never an hypocrite in the world, but will do what he can to ſave the life of his ſin, though it be with the loſs of his ſoul. O Sirs! Satan can be contented that Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites ſhould yield to God in many things, provided they will be but true to him in ſome one thing; for he very well knows, that one ſin lived in, and allowed, gives him as much advantage againſt the ſoul, as more. Satan can hold a man faſt enough by one ſin, as the Fowler can hold the bird faſt enough by one claw; Satan knows, that one ſin lived in and allowed, will marr all a mans ſweeteſt duties and ſervices; as one dead fly will marr the whole box of precious ointment, and as one jarring ſtring will bring the ſweeteſt muſick out of tune.

Now all this Satan knows, and therefore he labours mightily to engage Hypocrites to live in the allowance of ſome one ſin. O Sirs! remember that as one hole in a Ship will ſink it, and as one ſtab at the heart will kill a man, and as one glaſs of poyſon will poyſon a man, and as one act of Treaſon will make a man a Traitor; ſo one

There is never an Hypocrite in the world, but lyes under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of one baſe luſt or another, but lives under the reign and dominion of one ſin or another. That ſoul that can in ſincerity of heart appeal to a heart-ſearching God, that 'tis otherwiſe with him (<hi>viz.</hi> That he does not live nor allow himſelf in any one ſinful way or practiſe) that ſoul, I dare aſſure in the Lord's name, is no hypocrite, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139, 23, 24.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As an Hypocrites heart is never throughly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued to a willingneſs to part with every luſt, ſo neither is his heart throughly ſubdued to a willingneſs to perform all known duties; ſometimes he is all for publick duties, but makes no conſcience of cloſet-duties, or of family-duties; ſometimes he is all for the duties of the firſt Table, but makes no conſcience of the duties of the ſecond Table; and ſometimes he is all for the duties of the ſecond Table, but makes no conſcience of the duties of the firſt Table; if he obeyes one command, he willingly lives in the neglect of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; if he does one duty, he will be ſure to caſt off ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;

After ſome men have made a long and high profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſome one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved luſt or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which they would never let go, parts Chriſt and them for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</note> but he intended only to lay up for himſelf, and to provide againſt a rainy day; it is probable that he had no great mind to ſtay long with his Lord, and therefore he was reſolved to make the beſt market he could for himſelf. <hi>Judas</hi> being willing to ſet up for himſelf, under a cloak of holineſs, he practiſes the greateſt unfaithfulneſs. Though the Eagle ſoars high, yet ſtill her eye is upon her prey; ſo though <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> did ſoar high in profeſſion, yet his eye was ſtill upon his prey, upon his bags; and ſo he might have it, he cared not who went without it; ſo he might be rich, he did not care though his Lord and his retinue grew never ſo poor. <hi>Judas</hi> under all his ſhews of ſanctity, had not ſo much as common honeſty in him; counterfeit holineſs is often made a ſtalking horſe to much unrighteouſneſs; but certainly it were better, with the Philoſopher, to have honeſty without Religion, than to have Religion without honeſty. An Hypocrite may exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe himſelf in ſome outward, eaſie, ordinary duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; but when ſhall you ſee an Hypocrite laying the ax to the root of the Tree, or a ſearching and trying his own heart, or ſeverely judging his boſom ſins, or humbly mourning and lamenting over ſecret corruptions, or doubling his guards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his own ſoul, or rejoycing in the graces, ſervices or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of others, or ſtriving or preſſing after the higheſt pitches of grace, holineſs and communion with God, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:52491:167"/> more to caſt out the beam out of his own eye, than the mote out of his brother's eye, or to be more ſevere againſt his own ſins, than againſt the ſins of others? Alas! an Hypocrite is ſo far from practiſing theſe duties, that he thinks them either ſuperfluous or impoſſible. An Hypocrites obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is alwayes a limited and ſtinted obedience; it is either limited to ſuch commands which are moſt ſutable to his eaſe, ſafety, honour, profit, pleaſure, &amp;c. or elſe it is limited to the outward part of the command, and never extends it ſelf to the inward and ſpiritual part of the command; as you may ſee in the Scribes and Phariſees; their obedience was all outward, they had no regard at all to the inward and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual part of any command; as is evident in that high charge that Chriſt gives in againſt them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. They did not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they did not commit adultery, they had an eye to the outward part of the command; but Chriſt charges them with unjuſt and adulterous thoughts, unchaſt glances, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative wickedneſs, ſpeculative uncleanneſs, &amp;c. they having no regard at all to the inward and ſpiritual part of any command; common grace looks only to ſome particular du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but ſaving grace looks to all.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, There is never an Hypocrite in the world that makes God, or Chriſt, or holineſs, or his doing, or receiving good in his ſtation, relation or generation; his grand end, his higheſt end, his ultimate end of living in the world; pleaſures, profits and honours, are the Hypocrites all he aims at in this world; they are his Trinity which he adores and ſerves,<note place="margin">1 John 2.16.</note> and ſacrificeth himſelf unto; an Hypocrite's ends are corrupt and ſelfiſh. God may poſſibly be at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er end of his work, but ſelf is at the further end; for he that was never truly caſt out of himſelf,<note place="margin">John 6.26. Mat. 6.1, 5, 16. Gal. 4.17. Iſa. 58.3. Mal. 3.14. zech. 7.5, 6, 7. Gen. 34.21, 22</note> can have no higher end than himſelf. An Hypocrite is all for his own glory, he acts for himſelf, and from himſelf; ſo I may have the profit, the credit, the glory, the applauſe, come of God's glory what will; this is the language of an unſound heart. An Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite will ſeem to be very godly when he can make a gain of godlineſs, he will ſeem to be very holy when holineſs is the way to outward greatneſs and happineſs; but this religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wickedneſs will double damn the Hypocrite at laſt. Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ends are the operative ingredients in all an Hypocrite does, ſelf is the chief Engine, ſelf is the great wheel that ſets all an hypocrites wheels a going. When hypocrites take up Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,<note place="margin">Rom. 16.18. Phil. 3.19.</note> 'tis only to ſerve their own turns, to bring about their own carnal ends; they ſerve not the Lord, but their own bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; they uſe Religion only as a ſtream to turn about their own Mill, and the more neatly to effect their own carnal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> will needs be baptized, and he is very deſirous to have power to give the holy Ghoſt to others; but his aim being only to get a name,<note place="margin">Acts 8.21.</note> and to get money, <hi>Peter</hi> tells him to his face, that his heart was not right in the ſight of God. No man can go higher than his principles, and therefore an hypocrite having no higher principles than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, all he does muſt needs be terminated in himſelf. Look, as all the Rivers that come from the Sea, do return back again to the Sea from whence they come, ſo all thoſe duties which ariſe from a mans ſelf, muſt needs center in a mans ſelf. An hypocrite alwayes makes himſelf the end of all his ſervice; but let ſuch hypocrites know, that though their profeſſion be never ſo glorious, and their duties never ſo abundant, yet
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:52491:168"/> their ends being ſelfiſh and carnal, all their pretentions and performances are but beautiful abominations in the ſight of God. An hypocrite has alwayes a ſquint eye, and ſquint ey'd aims, and ſquint ey'd ends in all he does.<note place="margin">Numb. 22, 23. Chapters. 2 Pet. 2.15. 2 King. 10.</note>

Look, as the Eagle hath an eye upon her prey when ſhe flies higheſt, ſo theſe Jews in all their faſting, praying, mourning, they had only an eye to their own eaſe, deliverance, freedom, &amp;c. in all their Religious duties they were acted from evil princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and carried on by ſelf-reſpects; and therefore <hi>Daniel</hi> denies, that in all that ſeventy years captivity they had prayed to any purpoſe. <hi>All this is come upon us,</hi>

The ends of a mans actions are alwayes a great diſcovery either of ſincerity or hypocriſie. Look, as great gifts, not ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſincerity, are no ornaments to us; ſo great infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties not ſowred with hypocriſie, are no great deformities to us.

A ſincere Chriſtian aſcribes the praiſe of all to God,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.7, 8.</note> he ſets the crown on Chriſt's head alone, he will ſet God upon the throne, and make all things elſe his ſervants, or his foot-ſtool; all muſt bow the knee to God, or be trodden in the dirt; he will love nothing, he will imbrace nothing but what ſets God higher, or brings God neerer to his heart. The glory of God is the mark, the white, that the ſincere, Chriſtian has in his eye. The ſincere Chriſtian lives not to himſelf,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. <hi>ult.</hi> Rev. 12.11.</note> but to him who lives for ever; he lives not to his own will, or luſts, or greatneſs, or glory in this world, but he lives to his glory, whoſe glory is dearer to him than his own Life. Look, as bright ſhining golden veſſels do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the beams of the Sun which they receive, but reflect them back again upon the Sun; ſo the ſincere Chriſtian return and reflects back again upon the Sun of righteouſneſs, the praiſe and glory of all the gifts, graces and vertues that they have received from him.

<pb n="305" facs="tcp:52491:174"/> he hates ſome ſins, but likes others, he loaths ſome but loves others, he oppoſes ſome but practiſes others; like the Angel of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> that hated the deeds of the <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> but loved luke-warmneſs.<note place="margin">Rev. 2.5, 6.</note> Many men deteſt theft that love covetouſneſs, abhor whoredom that like irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religiouſneſs, &amp;c. There is no hypocrite under heaven, that can truly ſay, I hate every falſe way; but a ſincere Chriſtian he hates all ſinful wayes, but his own firſt and moſt;<note place="margin">1 Kings 5.18.</note> an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right heart leaves no neſt-egg for Satan to ſit on, but the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite alwayes does. Mark, in true hatred there are ſix things obſervable.</p>
               <p>Firſt, True hatred includes an extream deteſtation; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> diſlike is not hatred, but true hatred is an extream loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Thou ſhalt caſt them away as a menſtrous cloth,</hi>

                  <hi>thou ſhalt ſay unto it, Get thee hence.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 2.20.</note> 
                  <hi>In that day a man ſhall caſt his idols of ſilver, and his idols of gold, which they made each one for himſelf to worſhip, to the Moles and to the Bats.</hi> Their deteſtation ſhould be ſo great, that they ſhould caſt their moſt coſtly idols of ſilver and gold, into the moſt dark, naſty, duſty corners; to teſtifie the ſincerity of their converſion to God, they ſhould hate and abhor, abandon and aboliſh their gold and ſilver idols which they valued above all others.</p>
               <p>Secondly, True hatred includes an earneſt ſeparation. He <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that hates his ſin would fain be ſeparated from his ſin:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.4.</note> 
                  <hi>For we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened.</hi> A ſincere Chriſtian finds no burden to lay ſo heavy and weighty upon his ſpirit as ſin, and therefore he groans to be delivered from it. In the Law,<note place="margin">Deut. 24.3.</note> he that hated his Wife did ſue out a bill of divorce from her. He that truly hates ſin, puts in many a bill into the Court of Heaven, that he may be for ever di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced from his ſin.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, True hatred includes an irreconcilable aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> He that hates ſin, has his heart for ever alienated from ſin; he who hates ſin, can never be one with ſin. Two angry
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:52491:175"/> men may be made friends,<note place="margin">Lawyers often fall out at the Bar, but are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well agreed when they meet at the Tavern.</note> but if two men hate each other, all friendſhip is everlaſtingly broken betwixt them. A man may be angry with ſin, and yet made friends with ſin again; but if once he comes to hate his ſin, then all friendſhip with ſin is everlaſtingly broken. When Chriſt and the ſoul comes to be really one, then ſin and the ſoul comes to be everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly two, &amp;c.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, True hatred includes a conſtant and perpetual conflict; the fleſh will be ſtill luſting againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh.<note place="margin">Gal. 5.17. Rom. 7.22, 23.</note> Though ſin and grace were not born together, and though ſin and grace ſhall never die to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; yet whilſt a believer lives in this world, they muſt live together; and whilſt ſin and grace do cohabit together, they will ſtill be oppoſing and conflicting one with another. That man that truly hates ſin, will everlaſtingly conflict with ſin, he will die fighting againſt his ſins as one of the Dukes of <hi>Venice</hi> died fighting againſt his enemies with his weapons in his hand. Well Chriſtians, remember this, Though to be kept from ſin brings moſt peace and comfort to us, yet for us to oppoſe ſin, and for God to pardon ſin, that brings moſt glory to God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, True hatred includes a deadly intention and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; for nothing ſatisfies hatred but death and ruin. <hi>Saul</hi> hated <hi>David,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 26.19, 20. 1 Sam. 23.23. Eſt. 5.14.</note> and ſought his life; he hunted him up and down as a Partridge in the mountains, he left no ſtone unturn'd, nor no means unattempted, whereby he might revenge himſelf upon <hi>David. Haman</hi> hated <hi>Mordecai,</hi> and nothing would ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie him but to bring him to a ſhameful death, to ſee him hang'd on a gallows fifty cubits high (which was deſign'd ſaith <hi>Lyra,</hi> to put <hi>Mordecai</hi> to the greater ſhame, for he hanging h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m from <hi>Haman's</hi> malice, and cauſed the miſchief which he had plotted againſt <hi>Mordecai,</hi> ſuddenly to fall upon his own
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:52491:175"/> pate; for he who was highly feaſted with the King one day,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 13.22, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33.</note> was made a feaſt for crows the next day. <hi>Abſalom</hi> hated <hi>Amnon</hi> and killed him. <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate hated the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians with a deadly hatred, he put many thouſands of them to death, and threatned and vowed that at his return from fighting againſt the <hi>Perſians</hi> he would put all the Chriſtians in his Empire to the ſword, but God prevented him, by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him off in that expedition. A Chriſtian that hates ſin, can't be ſatisfied but in the death and deſtruction of it; in all his duties the language of his ſoul is, Lord, let my ſins be deſtroyed, whoever eſcapes let not my ſins eſcape the hand of thy revenging juſtice: And in all Ordinances the langu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of his ſoul is, O Lord! when ſhall my ſins be ſubdued and mortified, when ſhall my curſed corruptions be brought to an under? yea, when ſhall they all be drowned in the Red-Sea of my Saviours bloud, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, True hatred includes an impartial averſation, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> true hatred is of the whole kind; but of this before. To wind up all, ask thy heart what is it that thou abhorreſt as the ſuperlative evil? what is that which thou wouldſt have ſeparated as far from thee, as heaven is from hell? what is that thy heart will never renew league or friendſhip with any more? what is that againſt which thy ſoul doth riſe, and with which (as <hi>Iſrael</hi> with <hi>Amalek</hi>) thou wilt have war for ever?<note place="margin">Exod. 17.16.</note> what is that which thou wilt be avenged of, and daily doſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the mortifying and crucifying of? what is that which thou ſetteſt thy heart againſt in the comprehenſive latitude thereof, whether great or little, open or ſecret? if it be ſin, if it be thy ſins, if it be all thy ſins, then aſſuredly here is a true hatred of ſin, and aſſuredly here is a moſt diſtinguiſhing character of a child of God, of a ſound converſion, and of a ſaving change. It was not wont to be thus with thee, nor is this findable in any hypocrite,<note place="margin">Judg. 14.3, 7.</note> or in any unconverted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon upon the face of the earth;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 13.15.</note> ſin was once to thee as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilah</hi> to <hi>Sampſon,</hi> but now it is to thee as <hi>Tamar</hi> to <hi>Amnon;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 20.12, 13.</note> once it was a ſweet morſel which thou heldſt faſt and wouldſt not let it go,<note place="margin">Iſa. 30.22.</note> but now it is the menſtruous cloth which thou
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:52491:176"/> caſteſt away,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 14.8.</note> ſaying, <hi>Get thee hence:</hi> Now with <hi>Ephraim</hi> thou cryeſt out, <hi>What have I to do any more with Idols?</hi> O, if it be indeed thus with thee, then thou haſt cauſe for ever to be much in bleſſing and in admiring of the Lord for his diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing grace and favour towards thee. O Sirs! the world is full of baits, ſnares and temptations, but whilſt the hatred of ſin burns in your breaſts, you may caſt up your caps, and throw the Gantlet to the world, the fleſh and the devil. Well, remember this for ever, There are three things an hypocrite can never do. 1. He can never mourn for ſin as ſin. 2. He can never mourn for the ſins of others as well as his own. <hi>Moſes, Lot, David, Jeremiah, Paul,</hi> and thoſe in that, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.4, 6. mourned for others ſins as well as their own; but <hi>Pharoah, Ahab, Judas, Demas, Simon Magus</hi> never did. 3. He can never hate ſin as ſin. But,</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Eighthly, No hypocrite is habitually low or little in his own eyes, no hypocrite has ordinarily mean thoughts of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8.1, 2. John 7.49. &amp; 9.34.</note> or a poor eſteem of himſelf; no hypocrite loves to leſſen himſelf to greaten Chriſt, to debaſe himſelf to exalt Chriſt; no hypocrite loves to be out-ſhin'd, all hypocrites love to write an I (not a Chriſt) upon what they do.

There is no hypocrite in the world, but ſets down his penny for a pound, and alwayes prizes himſelf above the Market, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.15, 16. <hi>And when he was departed thence, he lighted on</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honadab <hi>the ſon of</hi> Rechab, <hi>coming to meet him, and he ſaluted him, and ſaid to him, Is thine heart right as my heart is with thy heart? and</hi> Jehonadab <hi>anſwered, it is; if it be, give me thine hand, and be gave him his hand, and he took him up to him into his chariot; and he ſaid, come with me, and ſee my zeal for the Lord.</hi> Comets

An hypocrites heart is full of pride, when his deportment is moſt humble; he alwayes thinks beſt of himſelf and worſt of others, he looks upon his own vices as graces, and he looks upon other mens graces as vices, or at leaſt, as no true currant coyn.

Hypocrites are heartleſs in their cryes, and therefore they cry and howl, and howl and cry, and all to no purpoſe; they cry and murmur, and they howl and repine; they cry and blaſpheme, and they howl and rebel; and therefore they meet with nothing from heaven but frowns, and blows, and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.13. <hi>Wherefore the Lord ſaid, for as much as this people draw neer me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me.</hi> Ezek. 33.31. <hi>And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they ſit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they ſhew much love, but their heart goeth after their covetouſneſs.</hi> Though this people flocked to the Prophet in troops, as men and women do to places of pleaſure; and though they carried it before the Prophet, as if they were Saints, as if they were the people of God, as if they were affected with what they heard, as if they were reſolved to live out what the Prophet ſhould make out to them, yet their hearts run after their covetouſneſs.

An hypocrite may look at ſome outward, eaſie, ordinary duties of Religion, but he never makes conſcience of bringing his heart into any duties of Religion. When did you ever ſee an hypocrite a ſearching of his heart, or ſitting in judgment upon the corruptions of his ſoul, or lamenting and mourning over the vileneſs and wickedneſs of his ſpirit? 'Tis only the ſincere Chriſtian that is affected, afflicted and wounded with the corruptions of his heart.

But now all the work of an hypocrite, is to get his golden parts into his duties, and his ſilver tongue into his duties, and his nimble head into his duties; but he never makes conſcience of getting his heart into his duties. If any beaſts ſacrificed by Heathens (who ever lookt narrowly into the intrails) was found without heart, this was held ominous, and conſtrued

               <p>Eleventhly, An hypocrite never performes religious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> from ſpiritual principles, nor in a ſpiritual manner. An hypocrite is never inclined, moved and carried to God, to Chriſt, to holy duties, by the power of a new and inward principle of grace working a ſutableneſs between his heart and the things of God. An hypocrite reſts himſelf ſatisfied in the meer external acts of Religion, though he never feels any thing of the power of Religion in his own ſoul. An hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite looks to his words in prayer, and to his voice in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and to his geſtures in prayer, but he never looks to the frame of his heart in prayer. An hypocrites heart is never toucht with the words his tongue utters, an hypocrites ſoul is never divinely affected, delighted, or graciouſly warmed with any duty he performs. An hypocrites ſpiritual performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces never flow from ſpiritual principles, nor from a heart univerſally ſanctified; though his works may be new, yet his heart remains old, his new practiſes alwayes ſpring from old principles; and this will prove the hypocrites bane,<note place="margin">

An hypocrite may know much, and pray much, and hear much, and faſt much, and give much, and obey much, and all to no purpoſe, becauſe he never manages any thing he does in a right man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; he never carries on his work from inward principles of faith, fervency, life, love, delight, &amp;c.

To delight in God is one of the higheſt acts of grace; and how can an hypocrite put forth one of the higheſt acts of grace, who hath no grace? An hypocrite may know much of God, and talk much of God, and make a great profeſſion of God, and be verbally thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to God; but he can never love God, nor truſt in God, nor delight in God, nor take up his reſt in God, &amp;c. 2. An hypocrite knows not God, and how then can he delight in that God whom he does not know? An hypocrite has no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſaving, transforming, experimental, affectionate, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical knowledge of God; and therefore he can never take any pleaſure or delight in God. 3. There is no ſutableneſs between an hypocrite and God, and how then can an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite delight himſelf in God? There is the greateſt contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty imaginable 'twixt God and an hypocrite. God is light, and the hypocrite is darkneſs;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.15, 16</note> God is holineſs, and he filthineſs; God is righteouſneſs, and he unrighteouſneſs; God is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and he emptineſs. Now what complacency can there be where there is ſuch an utter contrariety. 4. Every hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites heart is full of enmity againſt God, and how then can he delight himſelf in God? <hi>The carnal mind is enmity againſt God,</hi>

                  <hi>for it is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi> The beſt part of an hypocrite is not only averſe, but utterly adverſe to God and all goodneſs.

An Hypocrite alwayes terminates his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in ſomething on this ſide God, Chriſt and Heaven. Look, as the Apricock-tree, though it leans againſt the wall, yet it is faſt rooted in the earth; ſo though an hypocrite may lean towards God, and towards Chriſt, and towards heaven, yet his delight is ſtill rooted faſt in one creature-comfort or another, &amp;c.<note place="margin">Mark 6.</note> God nor Chriſt is never the adequate object of an hypocrites delight. An hypocrite is never principled to delight himſelf in a holy God, neither can he cordially, divinely, habitually, delight himſelf in holy duties. An hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite may reform many evil things, and he may do many good duties, and yet all this while it is only his practiſes, but not his heart or principles that are changed and altered. Mark, though an hypocrite hath nothing in him which is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to a Chriſtian as a Chriſtian, yet he may be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat reſemblance of a Chriſtian in all thoſe things which are not eſſential to him. An hypocrite in all the externals of Religion, may be the compleat picture of a ſincere Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; but then if you look to his principles, and the manner of his managing of holy duties, there you will find him lame and defective, and as much unlike a ſincere Chriſtian,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 19.13, 16.</note> as ever <hi>Michal's</hi> Image was unlike to <hi>David;</hi> and this will prove the great crack, the great break-neck of hypocrites at laſt.</p>
               <p>O Sirs! It is conſiderable, that outward motives and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural principles have carried many Heathens to do many great and glorious things in the world. Did not <hi>Siſera</hi> do as great things as <hi>Gideon?</hi> the difference did only lye here, that the great things which <hi>Gideon</hi> did, he did from more ſpiritual principles and raiſed conſiderations, than any <hi>Siſera</hi> was act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by.<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> And did not <hi>Diogenes</hi> trample under his feet the great and glorious things of this world, as well as <hi>Moſes?</hi> The

                  <note place="margin">Chryſoſt.</note> to his Hearers; This is that (ſaith he) which is like to undo your ſouls, you hear your Miniſters as ſo many minſtrels to pleaſe the ear, not to pierce the conſcience. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> confeſſeth, that the delight which he took before his converſion in Saint <hi>Ambroſes</hi> Sermons, was more for the eloquence of the words, than the ſubſtance of the matter. Hypocrites are taken more with the wit, eloquence of ſpeech, action, quickneſs of fancy, ſmoothneſs of ſtile, neatneſs of expreſſion, and rareneſs of notion, than they are with the ſpirituality, purity and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Word, which they either hear or read. Theſe hypocrites are like thoſe children, who are more taken with the fine flowers that are ſtrewed about the diſh, than they are with the meat that is in the diſh, and that are more taken with the red weeds and blew bottles that grow in the field, than they are with the good corn that grows there. But now, look as the prudent Farmer is taken more with a few hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls of ſound corn, than he is with all the gay weeds that be in the field; ſo a ſincere Chriſtian is more taken with a few ſound truths in a Sermon, than he is taken with all the ſtrong lines, and high ſtrains and flouriſhes of wit; or than he is taken with ſome new coyned phraſes, or ſome quaint expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, or ſome ſeraphical notions, with which a Sermon may be deckt or dreſt up. Some are taken with the Word as the profeſſion of it brings in cuſtomers into their Shops, and keeps up their credits in the world; others are taken with the Word, as it ſeems to tickle their ears and pleaſe their fancies: Some are affected with Sermons, becauſe of the elegancy of the ſtile, delicacy of the words, ſmoothneſs of the language, and gracefulneſs of the delivery. And theſe deal by Sermons as many do by their Noſegays that are made up of many pickt (ſweet) flowers, who after they have ſmelt to them a while, caſt them into a corner, and never mind
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:52491:188"/> them more; ſo theſe after they have commended a Sermon, after they have highly applauded a Sermon, they caſt away the Sermon, they ſmell to the Sermon (if I may ſo ſpeak) and ſay it is ſweet, it is ſweet, and preſently they throw it by as a Noſegay that is withered, and of no further uſe. But now a ſincere heart ſavours the Word, and reliſhes the Word, and is affected and taken with the Word, as it is a holy Word, a ſpiritual Word, a pure Word, which the moſt refined hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite under heaven never was affected or taken with, nor can be, whilſt hypocriſie keeps the throne in his ſoul. But,</p>
               <p>Thirteenthly and laſtly, An hypocrite can't endure to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> tryed, and ſearcht, and laid open; an hypocrite hates the light, and had rather go to hell in the dark, than come to be weighed in the ballance of the Sanctuary.<note place="margin">John 3.20.</note> A ſoul-ſearching Miniſtry is to an hypocrite a tormenting Miniſtry, that's no man for his money that will never let his conſcience alone; he knows he is like a velvet ſaddle, velvet without and ſtraw within; he knows he is like a whited ſupulcher,<note place="margin">Mat. 23.27, 28.</note> glorious without, and dead bones within; and therefore his heart riſes and ſwells againſt ſuch a man, and ſuch a Miniſtry, that is all for the anatomizing and laying of him open to himſelf, and to the world.

                  <p>Now in this fifth and laſt Chapter, I ſhall lay down ſome Propoſitions and Directions, that ſo you may ſee what a ſober uſe and improvement Chriſtians ought to make of their evidences for Heaven; and how in the uſe of gracious evidences they ought to live above their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious evidences, and how to exalt and lift up Chriſt above all their graces, evidences and performances.</p>
               </argument>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> FIrſt Propoſition. 'Tis the wiſdom, and ought to be the work of every Chriſtian to own the leaſt meaſure of grace that is in him,<note place="margin">Though our graces like <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon's</hi> Army, are but a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our ſins, which like the <hi>Midianites</hi> are innumerable, yet a handful of grace is to be owned in the midſt of an Hoſt of ſins.</note> though it be mixed and mingled with many weakneſſes and infirmities: Sin is Satan's work, and grace is Chriſt's work; and therefore Chriſt's work ought to be eyed and owned, though it be mingled with much of Satan's work. That Chriſtian is much clouded and benight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who hath two eyes to behold his ſins, but never an eye to ſee his graces. Chriſt gets no glory, nor the ſoul gets no good, when a Chriſtian is ſtill a poring upon his ſins. How can that Chriſtian prize a little grace, and bleſs God for a little grace, and improve a little grace, who won't own a little grace becauſe it is mingled with many weakneſſes? Shall the Husbandman own a little wheat when mingled with a great deal of chaff?<note place="margin">1 Sam. 21.13, 14.</note> ſhall the Goldſmith own a little fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of gold when mingled with a great deal of duſt? and ſhall not a Chriſtian own a little grace when mingled with a great many failings? <hi>David</hi> had a great many infirmities, yet he owns his uprightneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.23. <hi>I was upright be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                  <note place="margin">Job 3.</note> had a great many weakneſſes, yet he owns his integrity, <hi>Job.</hi> 27.5. <hi>Till I die I will not remove my inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity from me.</hi> Ver. 6. <hi>My righteouſneſs I hold faſt, and will not let it go, my heart ſhall not reproach me ſo long as I live.</hi> The Spouſe was ſenſible of her blackneſs, yet owns her comelineſs, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.5. <hi>I am black, but comely.</hi> So <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2. <hi>I ſleep, but my heart waketh. Jeremiah</hi> was a man of many failings, yet he owns his hope in God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.17.<note place="margin">Jer. 20.14—<hi>ult.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Thou art my hope in the day of evil:</hi> The poor man in the Goſpel was very ſenſible of the ſad reliques and remains of unbelief that was in him, and yet with a holy boldneſs and confidence he pleads his faith, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.24. <hi>Lord, I believe, help my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief. Peter</hi> miſcarried ſadly,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.69—<hi>ult</hi>
                  </note> and yet he owns his love to Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.15. <hi>Lord, thou knoweſt that I love thee.</hi> Ver. 16. <hi>Lord, thou knoweſt that I love thee.</hi> Ver. 17. <hi>Lord, thou knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt that I love thee. Paul</hi> had his infirmities and weakneſſes hanging upon him, witneſs that 7th of the <hi>Romans;</hi> and yet how frequently and boldly does he own the grace of God that was in him, throughout his Epiſtles. Nothing keeps grace more at an under, than mens not owning of a little grace, becauſe it is mingled with many infirmities. The beſt way to be greatly good, is to own a little, little good, though in the midſt of much evil. But,</p>
               <p>The ſecond Propoſition is this. It is your wiſdom, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſhould be your work, to look upon all your graces and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious evidences as favours given you from above, as gifts dropt out of heaven into your hearts, as flowers of Paradiſe ſtuck in your boſoms by a divine hand. A man ſhould never look upon his graces or his gracious evidences,<note place="margin">Of thine own (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) have we given thee, 1 Chron. 29.14:</note> but ſhould be ready to ſay, theſe are the jewels of glory with which God has beſpangled my ſoul, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. <hi>What haſt thou that thou haſt not received?</hi> What gift? what grace? what experience? what evidence haſt thou that thou haſt not received? All the light, and all the life, and all the love, and all the joy, and all the fear, and all the faith, and all the hope, and all the patience, and all the humility, &amp;c. that thou haſt, with all the evidences that ariſe from diſcovery of thoſe graces, are
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:52491:191" rendition="simple:additions"/> all grace gifts, they are all from above. <hi>Every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jam. 1.17.</note> 
                  <hi>and cometh down from the father of lights.</hi> Look, as all light flows from the Sun, and all water from the Sea, ſo all temporal, ſpiritual and eternal good flows from heaven. All your graces, and the greateſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies that are in you, do as much depend upon God and Chriſt, as the light doth upon the Sun, or as the Rivers do upon the Sea,<note place="margin">Joh. 15.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Pſal. 87.7.</note> or as the branches do upon the root. All my ſprings are in thee; all the ſprings of comfort that I have communicated to my ſoul, and all the ſprings of grace that I have to quicken me, and to evidence the goodneſs and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my ſpiritual eſtate and condition to me, they are all in thee. When a Chriſtian looks upon his wiſdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, it concerns him to ſay, Here is wiſdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, I but 'tis from above; here is ſome weak love work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards Chriſt, but 'tis from above; here's joy, and comfort, and peace, &amp;c. but theſe are all ſuch flowers of Paradiſe as never grew in natures garden. Now when a Chriſtian looks thus upon all thoſe coſtly Diamonds of grace, of glory, with which his ſoul is bedeckt, he keeps low, though his graces and gracious evidences are high. Where this Rule is neglected, the ſoul will be endangered of being ſwell'd and pufft.</p>
               <p>It was a great ſaying of a very worthy man that is now with God, <hi>viz,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Fox.</hi>
                  </note> That as he often got much good by his ſins, ſo he often got much hurt by his graces. Dear hearts, when you look upon the ſtream, remember the fountain; when you look upon the flower, remember the root; when you look upon the Stars, remember the Sun; and when ever you look upon your graces, then be ſure to remember Chriſt the fountain of grace, elſe Satan will certainly be too hard for you: Satan is ſo ſubtile, ſo artificial, and ſo critical, that he can make your very graces to ſerve him againſt your graces conquering joy by joy, ſorrow by ſorrow, humility by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, fear by fear, and love by love; if you don't look upon all your graces as ſtreams flowing from the fountain above, and as fruits growing upon the Tree of life that is in
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:52491:191" rendition="simple:additions"/> the midſt of the Paradiſe of God. Therefore when one of your eyes is fixt upon your graces, let the other be alwayes fixt upon Chriſt the fountain of grace.<note place="margin">1 John 16.</note>

                  </note> and ſuch a creature that is ſtrengthned, maintained, cheriſhed and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held in your ſouls, in life and power, in beauty and glory, by nothing below the ſpiritual, internal and glorious operations of Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.10. <hi>That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleaſing, being fruitful in every good work, and increaſing in the knowledge of God.</hi> Ver. 11. <hi>Strengthned with all might according to his glorious power, unto all patience and long-ſuffering with joyfulneſs.</hi> Now when ever you look upon grace as a love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, beautiful creature, O then remember that might and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious power of Chriſt, by which this creature is preſerved and ſtrengthned. Chriſtians, your graces are holy and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plants of Chriſt's own ſetting and watering, and will you mind the plants more than that noble hand that ſet them? 'Tis Chriſt alone that can cauſe the deſires of his people to bud, and their graces to bloſſom,<note place="margin">Iſa. 58.11. &amp; 35.6, 7.</note> and their ſouls to be like a watered garden, green and flouriſhing; and therefore let the eye of your ſouls be firſtly, moſtly and chiefly fixt upon Chriſt. But,</p>
               <p>The third Propoſition is this. When you look upon your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> graces in the light of the Spirit, it highly concerns you to look narrowly to it, that you don't renounce and rejecty our
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:52491:192"/> graces, as weak and worthleſs evidences of your intereſt in Chriſt, and of that eternal happineſs and bleſſedneſs that comes by Chriſt.

I readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grant, that you muſt not truſt in your graces, nor make a Saviour of your graces; but yet you ought to look upon your graces, as ſo many ſigns and teſtimonies of the love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God to your ſouls. What certainty can there be of Election, Remiſſion of ſin, Juſtification or Glorification, if there be not a certainty of your Sanctification and Renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; if that perſwaſion that is in you ahout your grace or ſanctification be falſe, then that perſwaſion that is in you concerning remiſſion of ſin, predeſtination, juſtification and eternal ſalvation is falſe: This highly concerns all them to conſider, that would not be miſerable in both worlds. I know many cry up Revelations, Impreſſions, Viſions (yea the viſions of their own hearts) and ſpeak lightly and ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the graces of the Spirit, of ſanctification, of holineſs, as evidences of the goodneſs and happineſs of a Chriſtians condition. There were ſome in <hi>James</hi> his time, who cryed up faith,<note place="margin">James 2.18.</note> and union, and communion with Chriſt, but were deſtitute of good works.

I conjecture the Reaſons may be ſuch as follow.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Many Profeſſors take up in a great name, and in a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> great profeſſion, and in great parts and gifts, though they have never found a through change,<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5.23. John 3.3, 5. 2 Cor. 5.17.

And hence it comes to paſs, that they make head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this way of evidencing the goodneſs and happineſs of a mans condition, by inward gracious qualifications. Of all
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:52491:193"/> men theſe are moſt apt to out-run the truth, and to run from one extream to another, and to be only conſtant in incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy. But,</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Many profeſſors are given up to ſpiritual judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (which are the ſoreſt of all judgments) <hi>viz.</hi> luke-warmneſs, dead-heartedneſs, formality, indifferency, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, blindneſs, hardneſs, and to ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould believe a lye,<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2.10, 11, 12.</note> becauſe they received not the love of the truth, that they might be ſaved. Now, is it any wonder to ſee ſuch men quarrel, and wrangle, and rail againſt the way and method of evidencing the goodneſs and happineſs of a mans ſpiritual condition, by inherent gracious qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? But,</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, In ſome this ariſeth from their luſts, which they indulge and connive at, and which they have a mind to live quietly in; they are deſirous to keep their peace, and yet unwilling to forſake their luſts; and hence they exclude this witneſs of water or ſanctification to teſtifie in the Court of Conſcience, whether they are beloved of God, or whether they are ſincere hearted or no, or whether they have the root of the matter in them or no; for the want of this witneſs, water or ſanctification, is a clear and full witneſs againſt them, that they are yet in their ſins, under wrath, and in the way to eternal ruin; and that they have nothing to do with peace,<note place="margin">Iſa. 57. <hi>ult.</hi> Pſal. 50.16.</note> or comfort, or the promiſes, or Chriſt, or heaven, to take God's name into their lips, ſeeing they ſecretly hate to be reformed. There are many fair Profeſſors that are foul ſinners, and that have much of God, and Chriſt, and heaven, and holineſs in their lips, when they have nothing but ſin and hell in their hearts and lives. Theſe mens converſions ſhame their profeſſion, and therefore they cry out againſt ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation as a ſure and bleſſed evidence of a mans juſtification: Such ſinners as live in a courſe of ſin, that make a Trade of ſin,<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 2.12.</note> that indulge their ſins, that take up arms in defence of ſin, that make proviſion for ſin, that make a ſport of ſin, that take pleaſure in ſin, and that have ſet their hearts upon their

               <p>Fourthly, There are many who are great ſtrangers to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> their own hearts and the bleſſed Scriptures, and are ignorant of what may be ſaid from the bleſſed Word,<note place="margin">'Tis ſad to be a ſtranger at home, and to be leaſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with a mans own heart. <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi>

The Scripture ſets ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant perſons below the Ox and the Aſs. Did men either ſee the deformity of ſin,<note place="margin">Iſa. 1.3.</note> or the beauty and excellency of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, they would never delight in the one, nor cry down the other. <hi>Peter</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.12.</note> tells you of ſome that ſpeak evil of the things that they underſtood not, they did reprehend that which they could not comprehend. Ignorance is a breeding ſin, a mother ſin, all ſins are ſeminally in ignorance; igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is the mother of all the miſtakes, and of all the miſrule in the world. Chriſt told the Sadduces,<note place="margin">Mat. 22.29.</note> 
                  <hi>That they did err not knowing the Scriptures;</hi> and ſo I may ſay many err in crying down ſuch ſigns and evidences of grace which are bottomed upon Scripture, becauſe they are ignorant of what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith in the caſe. But,</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The generality of Chriſtians are but Lambs, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Babes and Children in grace,<note place="margin">Iſa. 40.11. 2 Pet. 2.2, 3. 1 John 2.1.</note> the ſprings of grace runs low in them, their fears frequently over-top their faith, and their ſtrong paſſions and corruptions do often raiſe ſuch a duſt and ſmoak in their ſouls, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> they might have all the world, yea if their ſalvation lay upon it, they were not able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the leaſt meaſure of grace in their own ſouls. A little grace is next to none, ſmall things are hardly diſcerned; he
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:52491:194"/> had need to have a clear light and good eyes, that is to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern a hair, a mote, or an atome. A little grace is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable but by a ſhining light from above. There are none ſo full of fears, and doubts, and queſtions, and diſputes, about the truth of their faith in Chriſt, and the ſincerity of their love to Chriſt, as thoſe that leaſt believe and leaſt love. The Kingdom of God in moſt Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Mark 4.30, 31, 32.</note> is but as a grain of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard-ſeed, which is the leaſt of all ſeeds; and therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'tis no wonder they ſee it not. The root of the matter in moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians is but ſmall, and that ſmall root is often covered over with many ſinful infirmities and weakneſſes, and therefore we are not to look upon it as a ſtrange thing, if we ſee ſuch Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians not ſenſible of the root of the matter that is in them. Weak habits put forth ſuch faint actions (and with ſo much interruption) that it is not an eaſie thing to diſcern whether they are the products of ſpecial or of common grace. Now moſt Chriſtians having but ſmall meaſures of grace, holineſs and ſanctification in them; and theſe ſmall meaſures being much obſcured and buried under the prevalency of fears, doubts and unmortified luſts, can ſpeak but weakly and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for them; &amp; upon this ground they are not fond of bringing in this witneſs of ſanctification to ſpeak for them. In civil Courts men are not ambitious to bring ſuch witneſſes to the Bar, as can witnes but <hi>weakly</hi> &amp; <hi>faintly</hi> in their caſe. Tis ſo here.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, Satan is a grand enemy to the peace, joy, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, aſſurance, ſettlement and ſatisfaction of every poor Chriſtian; and therefore he will leave no ſtone unturn'd, nor no means unattempted,<note place="margin">Pſal. 77. Pſal. 88.</note> whereby he may keep them in a low, dark, unſettled and uncomfortable condition. When once a poor ſoul is brought over to Chriſt, how does the Devil beſtir himſelf to keep ſuch a ſoul ſo under fears, doubts and bondage, as that it may not in the leaſt have an eye to any thing that may have a proper tendency to its comfort, joy, aſſurance, peace or quiet.

Satan knows how to transform himſelf into an Angel of light; Satan does not alwayes appear in one and the ſame faſhion; but he appears in as many ſeveral ſhapes, faſhions and changes, as <hi>Proteus</hi> did among the Poets: To deceive ſome, he has aſſumed a lightſom body, as if he were an Angel of heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if he had been a holy one, cloathed with the brightneſs of celeſtial glory. To deceive others, he has appeared as an Angel of light, ſuggeſting ſuch things to them, and injecting ſuch things into them, under fair and ſpecious ſhews and pretences of Religion, Piety, Zeal and Holineſs, which have had a direct tendency to the diſhonour of God, the wounding of Chriſt, the grieving of the Spirit, the clouding or denying their evidences for heaven, the ſtrangling of their hopes, and the death of all their comforts and joy. But,</p>
               <p>Seventhly and laſtly, Some Chriſtians live under high en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> and ſingular manifeſtations of God's love to them, they have God every day a ſhedding abroad of his love into their hearts by the holy Ghoſt.<note place="margin">Rom. 5.5.

Now theſe choice ſouls who live daily in the glorious manifeſtations of the Spirit, and enjoy a little heaven on this ſide heaven, theſe many times are ſo taken up with their high communion with God, with their ſpiritual enjoyments, and with their taſtes of the glory of that other world, that they do not much mind ſuch evidences as we have had under our conſideration. And thus much for the Reaſons, why ſome cry down Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture marks, ſigns and evidences of grace, of holineſs, of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification; and why others don't much mind them, or take any great notice of them. But,</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The fourth Propoſition is this. If this way of trying our ſpiritual eſtates by holy and gracious qualifications, were not both lawful and uſeful, then certainly the holy Spirit would never have preſcribed it, nor never have preſt men ſo earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly upon it, as we find he has done in the bleſſed Scripture. Take a taſte, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Examine your ſelves whether ye be in the faith;</hi>

The final try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of our eternal eſtates, doth immediately and ſolely belong to the Court of heaven, but the diſquiſitive part belongs to us. Here are two emphatical words in the Greek; Firſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>examine your ſelves.</hi> The word in the general ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies to take an experimental knowledge of any thing, that is either uncertain, unknown or hidden; moſt men are great ſtrangers to God, to Chriſt, to Scripture, and to themſelves, and therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Examine your ſelves.</hi> Now if there were not ſure marks and infallible ſigns whereby men may certainly know what their preſent eſtate is, and
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:52491:195"/> how 'tis like to go with them in another world, the redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled commnad of the Apoſtle would be in vain. The ſecond Greek word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>prove your ſelves.</hi> The original word ſignifies a ſevere and diligent inquiſition into our ſelves, ſo as to have a full experience of what is in us. Doubtleſs the Apoſtle would never call again and again upon us, to try and examine our ſelves whether we be in the faith, if it were not lawful to come to the knowledge of our faith, or of our being in the ſtate of faithful Chriſtians in a diſcurſive way, arguing from the effect to the cauſe. So in that, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Wherefore the rather brethren, give all diligence to make your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and election ſure.</hi> The Greek word tranſlated <hi>give dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,</hi> is very emphatical,<note place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> it ſignifies to do a thing not in an overly, lazy, careleſs way, but to do a thing with induſtry, vigilancy and unweariedneſs of ſpirit. Now it is granted on all hands, that election cannot be made more ſure in reſpect of God or it ſelf, but only in reſpect of us, that we may be more perſwaded of it. Election cannot be made more ſure than it is already, for thoſe whom God hath elected ſhall be certainly glorified, but we muſt make it ſure on our parts;<note place="margin">Rom. 8.29.30.</note> that is, we muſt labour to have a real bottom and grounded aſſurance that we are elected by God in his eternal decree, to obtain life and glory by Jeſus Chriſt. There is a double cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, 1. There is <hi>certitudo objecti,</hi> a certainty of the object; ſo our election is ſure with God, for with him both it and all things are unchangable. 2. There is <hi>certitudo ſubjecti,</hi> the certainty of the ſubject; and ſo we muſt make our election ſure to our ſelves in our own hearts and conſciences. Now the means whereby we are to come to this aſſurance, is by adding grace to grace, and by cauſing thoſe ſeveral graces to abound in us. This is the way of wayes to make all ſure to us. Now by theſe Scriptures 'tis moſt evident, that we ſtand en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to make our election ſure by holy ſigns and marks. But,</p>
               <p>The fifth Propoſition is this. That other precious Saints that are now triumphing in glory, have pleaded their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in God's love, and their hopes of a better life from graces
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:52491:196"/> inherent.<note place="margin">Grace in the working of it, is often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to life. Now, look as natural life is diſcerned by the actions thereof, as by ſo many ſigns, ſo alſo is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural life.</note> I'le only point at ſome of thoſe Scriptures among many others, that clearly ſpeak out this truth; the firſt Epiſtle of <hi>John, James</hi> 2.17—<hi>ult. Job.</hi> 23.10, 11, 12. and the whole 31. Chapter of <hi>Job, Pſal.</hi> 119.6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.2, 3. <hi>Neh.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi> &amp; 13.14, &amp;c. Now all theſe Scriptures do evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove, that the precious ſervants of the Lord did take their graces for precious ſigns and teſtimonies of God's love, of their intereſt in Chriſt, and thereby received much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, peace and ſatisfaction. And truly, to deny the fruit growing upon the Tree to be an evidence that the Tree is alive, is to me as unreaſonable as it is abſurd: Certainly 'tis one thing to judge by our graces, and another thing to truſt in our graces, to make a Saviour of our graces. There is a great deal of difference betwixt declaring and deſerving Chriſtians, they may doubtleſs look to their graces as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of their part in Chriſt and ſalvation (and the clearer and ſtronger they are, the greater will be their comfort and aſſurance) but not as cauſes. No man advanced free grace like <hi>Paul;</hi> no man debaſed his own righteouſneſs like <hi>Paul,</hi> he counted it but dung and droſs; and no man exalted the righteouſneſs of Chriſt like <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 3.6, 7, 8, 9</note> and yet by this way of ſigns he gathered much comfort and aſſurance, 2 <hi>Tim,</hi> 4.7, 8. <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith, henceforth is laid up for me a crown of righteouſneſs.</hi> How plainly, how fully doth he here conclude his right to the crown of life, from his fighting a good fight, his finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his courſe (in a way of grace and holineſs) and his keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the faith.<note place="margin">

So in that, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Our rejoycing is this, the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of a good conſcience, that in godly ſincerity we have had our converſation in the world.</hi> His joy was founded on the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his conſcience; but from what did his conſcience teſtifie? from his ſincere converſation. Again, take that memorable inſtance of <hi>Job,</hi> God hid his face from him, the arrows of the Almighty ſtuck faſt in him, Satan was let looſe
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:52491:196"/> upon him, the wife of his boſom proved a tempter to him, a tormenter of him; his moſt inward acquaintance deſerted him, reproached him, and condemned him as an hypocrite; God writ bitter things againſt him, and made him to poſſeſs the iniquities of his youth, all was clouded above him, and he ſtript of all the outward comforts that did once ſurround him; ſo that he had nothing left to ſtay him, to refreſh him, to ſupport him, and to be a comfort and joy to him,<note place="margin">Job 1.8. &amp; 2.3.</note> but the ſenſe of his integrity, and the evidence he had of his own uprightneſs, his own righteouſneſs, <hi>Job.</hi> 27.5. <hi>Till I die I will not remove my integrity from me.</hi> Ver. 6. <hi>My righteouſneſs I hold faſt, and will not let it go; my heart ſhall not reproach me ſo long as I live. Job</hi> was under great afflictions, ſore tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and deep deſertions; now that which was his cordial, his bulwark in thoſe ſad times, was the ſenſe and feeling of his own uprightneſs, his own righteouſneſs; the ſenſe and feeling of the grace of God in him, kept him from fainting and ſinking under all his troubles. So 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments,</hi> &amp;c. In theſe words two things are obſervable; Firſt, that where there is a true knowledge of Chriſt, there is an obſervation of his commandements. Secondly, that by this obſervation of his royal Law, we may know that our knowledge is ſound and ſincere. He ſpeaks not of a legal, but of an evangelical keeping of his commandements. A conſcionable and ſerious endeavour to walk in a holy courſe of life, according to God's will revealed in his Word, is a moſt certain mark or evidence that we have a ſaving knowledge of God, and that we are his children, and heirs of glory. Such who ſincerely deſire, and unfeignedly purpoſe, and firmly reſolve, and faithfully endeavour to keep the commandements of God; theſe do keep the commandements of God evangelically and acceptably in the eye of God, the account of God. So <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>He that ſaith he abideth in him, ought himſelf alſo ſo to walk, even as he walked.</hi> Here you may obſerve two things; Firſt, that by faith we are implanted into Chriſt. Secondly, that we diſcover our implantation into Chriſt by our imitation of Chriſt. Such as plead for ſanctification a an evidence of
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:52491:197"/> juſtification, don't make their graces cauſes of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantation into Chriſt, or of their juſtification before the throne of Chriſt, but they make them teſtimonies and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to declare the truth of their real implantation into Chriſt, and of their being juſtified before the throne of Chriſt. So 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14. <hi>We know we are tranſlated from death to life, becauſe we love the brethren.</hi> The Apoſtle makes this a great ſign of godlineſs to love another godly man for godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſake; and the more godly he is, the more to love him and to delight in him. Now mark, this love of our brethren is not a cauſe of our tranſlation from death to life (for the very word tranſlated, ſuppoſeth ſuch a grace, ſuch a favour of God as is without us) but a ſign of our tranſlation from death to life. But of this I have ſaid enough already; as you may ſee if you will but read from page 189. to page 200. of this Book. But,</p>

                  <note place="margin">The moſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and ſafe way of coming to aſſurance, is the diſcourſive way in which a believer from the fruits and effects of grace infers he hath the habit, and from the habit concludes his j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

There are many ſcores of precious promiſes made over to them that believe, to them that truſt in the Lord, to them that ſet him up as the great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their fear, to them that love him, to them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in him, to them that obey him, to them that walk with him, to them that thirſt after him, to them that ſuffer for him, to them that follow after him, &amp;c. Now, all theſe ſcores of promiſes are made for the ſupport, comfort and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of all ſuch Chriſtians whoſe ſouls are beſpangled with grace. But now if we may not lawfully come to the knowledge of our faith, love, fear, delight, obedience, &amp;c. in a diſcourſive way, arguing from the effect to the cauſe. What ſupport, what comfort, what advantage ſhall a ſincere Chriſtian have by all thoſe ſcores of promiſſory places of Scripture? Doubtleſs all thoſe ſcores of promiſes would be as ſo many Suns without light, as ſo many ſprings without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as ſo many breaſts without milk, and as ſo many bodies without ſouls, to all gracious Chriſtians, were it not lawful for them to form up ſuch a practical ſyllogiſm as this is, <hi>viz.</hi> The Scripture doth plainly and fully declare, that he that
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:52491:197"/> believeth, feareth, loveth, obeyeth, &amp;c. is bleſſed, and ſhall be happy for ever. But I am ſuch a one that doth believe, fear, love, obey, &amp;c. therefore I am bleſſed, and ſhall be happy for ever. Now although it muſt be granted that the major of this Propoſition is Scripture, yet the aſſumption is from experience, and therefore a godly man being aſſiſted therein by the holy Ghoſt, may ſafely draw the concluſion as undeniable. O that you would ſeriouſly conſider, how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle would be the difference (ſhould you ſhut out this diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive way) betwixt a man and a beaſt, if a man ſhould aſſent to a thing unknown through an inſtinct and impreſſion, and ſhould to one who asks him a reaſon of his perſwaſion, be able to return no other anſwer but this; I am perſwaded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am perſwaded. But,</p>
               <p>The ſeventh Propoſition is this. That the Scripture giveth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> many ſigns and ſymptoms of grace; ſo that if a man cannot find all, yet if he diſcover ſome, yea but one, he may ſafely conclude, that all the reſt are there; he who hath but one in truth of the forementioned characters in this book, hath ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minally all; he who hath one link of the golden chain, hath the whole chain. Look, as he who hath one grace in truth, hath every grace in truth, though he doth not ſee every grace ſhining in his ſoul; ſo he that hath in truth any one evidence of grace in his ſoul, he hath virtually all. And, O that all weak, dark, doubting Chriſtians, would ſeriouſly and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ponder upon this Propoſition, for it may be a ſtaff to uphold them, and a cordial to comfort them under all their fears and faintings. But,</p>
               <p>The eighth Propoſition is this. Without the light of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> holy Ghoſt our graces ſhine not; our graces are only the means by which our condition is known to us;<note place="margin">Rom. 9.2.</note> the efficient cauſe of this knowledge, is the Spirit illuſtrating our graces and making them viſible, and ſo helping us to conclude from them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Now we have received not the ſpirit of the
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:52491:198"/> world, but the ſpirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.</hi> Our graces, our ſanctification, as well as our election, vocation, juſtification and glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are freely given to us of God; and the Spirit of God is given as well to diſcover the one as the other to us. Mark, the things freely given us may be received by us, and yet the receit of them not known to us; therefore the Spirit for our further conſolation doth (as it were) put his hand and ſeal to our receits,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.30.</note> whence he is ſaid to <hi>ſeal us up unto the day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</hi> The graces of the Spirit are a real earneſt of the Spirit, yet they are not alwayes an evidential earneſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an earneſt is often ſuperadded to our graces. For ever remember theſe few hints; 1. That it is the work of the Spirit to plant grace in the ſoul. 2. That it is the work of the Spirit to act and exerciſe the graces that he has planted there. 3. That it is the work of the Spirit to ſhine upon thoſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that he has planted in the ſoul, and to cauſe the ſoul to ſee and feel what he has wrote. 4. That it is the work of the Spirit to raiſe ſprings of comfort and joy in the ſoul, upon the diſcovery of that grace which he has wrote in the ſoul. O Chriſtians, till the Spirit of the Lord ſhine upon your graces,<note place="margin">Job 33.</note> you will ſtill be in the dark. 'Tis only God's own Interpreter that muſt ſhew a man his righteouſneſs. When the holy Ghoſt ſhines upon a Chriſtians graces, then a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian finds the ſprings of comfort to riſe in his ſoul, and then he finds the greateſt ſerenity and calmneſs in his ſpirit. O Sirs! no man can by any natural light or evidence in him, come to be aſſured of the grace wrought in his ſoul. Look, as no man can ſee the Sun but in the light of the Sun; ſo no man can ſee the graces of the Spirit but in the light of the Spirit.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.13.</note> A man may have grace, and not ſee it; he may be in a ſtate of grace and not know it; as the child lives in the womb but don't perceive it, is heir to a crown but don't know it.<note place="margin">Iſa. 50.10. Rom. 8.13.</note> O! till the Spirit ſhines upon his own work, a child of light may walk in darkneſs and ſee no light. Look, as no man can ſubdue his ſins but by the power of the Spirit; ſo no man can ſee his graces but in the light of the Spirit. The confidence that a believer hath of the truth of grace wrought
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:52491:198"/> in him, ſprings more from the Spirits removing his ſlaviſh fears, and anſwering his doubts, and ſhining upon his graces, and ſupporting his ſoul, than it does from that excellency and beauty of grace which ſhines in him. A man may read the promiſes over and over a thouſand times, and yet never be affected, delighted or taken with them, till the Spirit of the Lord ſet them home upon his ſoul. And a man may read the threatnings over and over a thouſand times, and yet never ſtartle nor tremble, though he knows himſelf guilty of thoſe very ſins againſt which the threatnings are denounced, till the Spirit of the Lord ſets home the threatnings in power upon his conſcience; and then every threatning will be like the hand-writing upon the wall, which will cauſe his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to be changed, and his thoughts to be troubled,<note place="margin">Dan. 5.6, 7.</note> and his joynts to be looſed, and his knees to be daſhed one againſt another. It is juſt ſo in the matter of our graces, and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous evidences, till the holy Spirit ſhine upon them, till in the light of the Spirit we come to ſee them, they won't be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing, comforting and refreſhing to us; and therefore let not the pious Reader think, that by the ſtrength of his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral light he ſhall ever attain to know the certainty of that grace which is in his ſoul, but let him rather beg hard of God for his holy Spirit, and that his Spirit may ſhine upon that good work which he hath begun in him, that ſo he may be perſwaded, aſſured and comforted. Without the light of the Spirit, the work of the Spirit can't be ſeen, no more than a book written in the faireſt hand or print, can be ſeen without light to ſee it or read it by. But,</p>
               <p>The ninth Propoſition is this. Sincere Chriſtians may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> and groundedly rejoyce,<note place="margin">Moſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence find that their aſſurance and joy riſes and falls as grace and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and as the evidences of grace and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs riſe and fall in their ſouls.</note> delight and take comfort in thoſe graces, or in thoſe divine qualities, which in the light of the Spirit they ſee and know are wrote in their ſouls. I don't ſay that a Chriſtian ſhould build the comfort of his juſtification upon his graces, or that he ſhould reſt on his graces, or truſt to his graces, or make a Saviour of his graces, for this would be ſuch a piece of Phariſaical Popery, as is juſtly to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:52491:199"/> and abhorred by all that love Chriſt, or are looking towards heaven: But this I ſay, a Chriſtian may make ſeveral uſes of his graces, he may ſafly look upon his graces as ſo many evidences of Chriſt's dwelling in him, and he may look upon his graces as ſo many heavenly bracelets, or as ſo many love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens from God in which he may ſafely rejoyce. The gracious evidences that I have laid down in this Treatiſe, are bleſſed ſymptoms of ſalvation, and therefore to rejoyce in them, can be no tranſgreſſion of any royal Law of heaven. He that can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally ſubſcribe to any of the gracious evidences that are laid down in this Book, has ſuch a fair certificate to ſhew for heaven, that no wicked man or hypocrite under heaven has the like to ſhew; and why ſuch a man ſhould not rejoyce in ſuch a certificate, I can't at preſent ſee. I may and ought to rejoyce in the works of Creation: O! how much more then ought I to rejoyce in the work of Renovation, in the work of ſanctification, which does ſo infinitely tranſcend the work of Creation? I may and ought to rejoyce in my natural life, health, ſtrength, beauty; and why then ſhould I not rejoyce in grace and holineſs, which is the life, health, ſtrength and beauty of my ſoul?<note place="margin">Cant. 4.9.</note> Chriſt delights in the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his people. <hi>Thou haſt raviſhed my heart,</hi> (or thou haſt behearted me, as the Hebrew runs) <hi>my ſiſter, my ſpouſe; thou haſt raviſhed my heart with one of thine eyes,</hi> (or with one glance of thine eyes, as ſome read it) <hi>with one chain of thy neck.</hi> The eye of faith, ſay ſome; the eye of love, ſay others: The chain of obedience, ſay ſome; the chain of ſpiritual graces, ſay others, raviſhed Chriſt's heart; the one eye of faith, the one chain of obedience, unhearted Chriſt, wounded Chriſt; this one eye, this one chain robbed Chriſt of his heart, and laid the Spouſe in the room of it. Now, ſhall Chriſt's heart be raviſhed with his childrens graces, and ſhall not their hearts be raviſhed and delighted with thoſe very graces that raviſh Chriſt's own heart?

<pb n="351" facs="tcp:52491:199" rendition="simple:additions"/> Spirit, eſpecially when I conſider, that the leaſt dram of grace is more worth than ten thouſand thouſand worlds,<note place="margin">Hab. 3.18. Gal. 6.14. Phil. 3.3.</note> as every awakened conſcience will tell you when they come to dye. Mark, firſtly, moſtly and chiefly a Chriſtian is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in God and Chriſt; but ſecondarily and ſubordinately he may rejoyce in thoſe graces, and in thoſe gracious evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences that God has given into his ſoul: Firſtly, moſtly and chiefly a Wife is to rejoyce in the perſon of her Husband, but ſecondarily, ſubordinately ſhe may rejoyce in the brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, in the ear-rings, in the jewels, in the gold chains that are given her by her Husband. But,</p>
               <p>The tenth Propoſition is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That that aſſurance that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> the people of God may riſe to by the ſight of their graces, and upon the ſight of their gracious evidences in the light of the ſpirit, is not ſo clear, and bright, and high, and full, a that it utterly excludes all fears, doubtings, conflicts,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.12. Phil. 3.12, 13, 14.</note> or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual agonies. Our knowledge of God, of Chriſt, of our ſelves, and of the bleſſed Scripture, which is the Rule of tryal, is imperfect in this life. And how then can our aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance be perfect? <hi>David,</hi> a man eminent in grace and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, had his up-hills and his down-hills, his Summer days and his Winter nights.<note place="margin">Pſal 73.25.

The grievous aſſaults of Satan, the power of unbelief, and the prevalency of other corruptions in a Chriſtians heart, may be ſuch as may ſhake (I don't ſay over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn) that aſſurance which a Chriſtian may gather from the ſight and evidence of his graces in the light of the ſpirit.<note place="margin">Gal. 5.17.</note> The fleſh luſteth as well againſt the ſpirit as it is a ſpirit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, as it luſteth againſt the ſpirit as it is a ſpirit of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification; and therefore ſuch an aſſurance as ſhall exclude

Now, if this were ſeriouſly apprehended, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died and minded by many weak Chriſtians, they would not at every turn call their ſpiritual eſtates into queſtion as they do, becauſe they find ſome ſeeds and ſtirrings of pride, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, vain-glory, and other ſinful humours and paſſions working in them.

               <p>The twelfth Propoſition is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is the great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> duty and concernment of Chriſtians to keep the evidences of their gracious and happy condition, alwayes bright and ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; Chriſtians ſhould make conſcience of blurring and disfiguring the golden characters of grace in their ſouls.

Satans maſter-piece is firſt to work Chriſtians to blot and blur their evidences for glory, by committing this or that hainous ſin; and then his next work is to rob them of their evidences for glory, that ſo though at the long run they may get ſafe to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that yet <hi>Jacob</hi> like they may go halting and mourning to their graves. Satan knows, that whilſt a Chriſtians evidences are bright and ſhining, a Chriſtian is temptation-proof. Satan may tempt him, but he can't conquer him; he may aſſault him, but he can't vanquiſh him. Satan knows, that whilſt a Chriſtians evidences for heaven are bright and ſhining, no afflictions can ſink him, nor no oppoſition ſhake him, nor no perſecution diſcourage him, nor no outward wants perplex him; and therefore he will uſe all his power and policy, all his arts, crafts and parts, to draw poor Chriſtians to blot and blur their evidences for glory. Satan knows, that a man may loſe one friend, and eaſily get another, loſe his Trade in one place, and ſoon get a Trade in another place; loſe health and get it, loſe an eſtate and get an eſtate, &amp;c. But if he loſes his evidences for heaven, he knows it will coſt him many a prayer, and many a ſigh, and many a groan, and many a tear, and many a ſad complaint, before he recovers his loſt eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and therefore his grand deſign is to plunder a Chriſtian of his evidences for heaven.

                  </note> whether their graces or gracious evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences ſparkle and ſhine, or are clouded and obſcured, is the Mediatory righteouſneſs of Chriſt. Beloved, there is a twofold righteouſneſs in Chriſt. Firſt, there is his eſſential and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal righteouſneſs as God: Now this eſſential perſonal righteouſneſs of Chriſt cannot be imputed to us. But then there is, Secondly, his Mediatory righteouſneſs, that is that righteouſneſs which he wrought for us as Mediator, whereby he did ſubject himſelf to the preceptt, to the penalties, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands &amp; curſes, anſwering both Gods vindictive and rewarding juſtice. This is communicated to us, and made ours: by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of which we ſtand <hi>recti in curia,</hi> juſtified in God's ſight. The Mediatory righteouſneſs of Chriſt is the matter of our juſtification. Now this Mediatory righteouſneſs of Chriſt includes, Firſt, the habitual holineſs of his perſon in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all ſin, and in the rich and plentiful preſence of all holy and requiſite qualities. Secondly, the actual holineſs of
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:52491:204" rendition="simple:additions"/> his life and death by obedience. By his active obedience he perfectly fulfilled the commands of the Law, and by his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive obedience, his voluntary ſufferings, he ſatisfied the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and commination of the Law for tranſgreſſions. Mark, that perfect ſatisfaction to divine juſtice in whatſoever it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, either in way of puniſhing for ſin, or obedience to the Law, made by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, God and Man, the Mediator of the new Covenant,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Oſiander</hi> was of opinion, that men were juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt as God, which opinion is largely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by <hi>Calvin</hi> in his Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> as a common head repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting all thoſe whom the Father hath given to him, and made over unto them that believe in him. This is that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs that is imputed to us in juſtification. No other righteouſneſs can juſtifie us before the throne of God. Look, as Chriſt was made ſin for us only by imputation, ſo we are made righteous only by the imputation of his righteouſneſs to us; as the Scripture clearly evidences, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>He hath made him to be ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> Jer. 23.6. <hi>The Lord our righteouſneſs.</hi> (A ſoul truly ſenſible of his own unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, would not have this ſentence, <hi>The Lord our righteouſneſs,</hi> blotted out of the Bible for ten thouſand thouſand worlds.) 1 Cor. 1.30. <hi>Chriſt Jeſus is made unto us of God, wiſdom, righteouſneſs, &amp;c.</hi> And pray, how is Chriſt made righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the believer? Not by way of infuſion, but imputation; not by putting righteouſneſs into him, but by putting a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs upon him, even his own righteouſneſs; by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting his merit, his ſatisfaction, his obedience unto them, through which they are accepted as righteous unto eternal life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>As by one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one ſhall many be made righteous.</hi> Chriſt's righteouſneſs is his in reſpect of inheſion, but it is ours in reſpect of imputation; his righteouſneſs is his perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, but ours meritoriouſly. Look, as there is a true and real union between us and Chriſt, ſo there is a real imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt's righteouſneſs to us. And a gracious ſoul triumphs more in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed, than he would have done if he could have ſtood in the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in which he was created. This is the crowning comfort to a ſenſible and underſtanding ſoul, that he ſtands righteous

               <p>Firſt, In this righteouſneſs there is enough to ſatisfie the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> juſtice of God to the utmoſt farthing.

               <p>Secondly, This Mediatory righteouſneſs of Chriſt takes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> away all our unrighteouſneſs, it cancels every bond, it takes away all iniquity, and anſwers for all our ſins.

               <p>Fifthly and laſtly, The righteouſneſs of Chriſt is the beſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> title that you have to ſhew for a Kingdom that ſhakes not,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.28. 1 Pet. 1.3, 4, 5. 2 Cor. 5.1, 2, 3, 4.</note> for riches that corrupt not, for an inheritance that fadeth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and for an houſe not made with hands, but one eternal in the heavens. The righteouſneſs of Chriſt is your life, your joy, your comfort, your crown, your confidence, your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, your all; and therefore whether your graces or graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous evidences do ſparkle and ſhine, or are clouded or blotted, yet ſtill keep a fixed eye and an awakned heart upon the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatory righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, for that's the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs by which you may happily live, comfortably die, and boldly appear before a Judgment-ſeat.

               <p>The third Royal Fort, that Chriſtians ſhould have their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> eyes, their hearts fixed upon, whether their graces or graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous evidences ſparkle and ſhine, or are obſcured and cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is the Covenant of grace. The Covenant of grace is a new compact or agreement which God hath made with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man out of his own meer mercy and grace,<note place="margin">Deut. 4.23. Iſa. 55.3. &amp; 54.7, 8, 9, 10. Jer. 31.31. Pſal. 50.5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hoſ. 14.4. Tit. 3.6. Eph. 1.5, 6, 7. Chap. 2.5 7, 8. Rom. 9.18, 23. Jer. 32.38, 39, 40, 41.

All man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind had been eternally loſt, and God had loſt all the glory of his mercy for ever, had he not of his own free-grace and mercy made ſuch an agreement with ſinful man. This Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is called a Covenant of grace, becauſe it flows from the meer grace and mercy of God. There was nothing out of God, nor nothing in God, but his meer mercy and grace that moved him to enter into Covenant with poor ſinners. In the
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:52491:206" rendition="simple:additions"/> Covenant of grace there are two things conſiderable, Firſt, the Covenant that God makes for himſelf to us, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of theſe Branches; 1. That he will be our God. 2. That he will give us a new heart, a new ſpirit. 3. That he will not turn away his face from us from doing of us good. 4. That he will put his fear into our hearts. 5. That he will cleanſe us from all our filthineſs, and from all our Idols. 6. That he will rejoyce over us to do us good. Secondly, here is the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which God doth make for us to himſelf, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in theſe things; 1. That we ſhall be his people. 2. That we ſhall fear him for ever. 3. That we ſhall walk in his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, keep his Judgments and do them. 4. That we ſhall not depart from him. Upon many accounts I may not enlarge on theſe things; but by theſe ſhort hints 'tis evident, that the Covenant of grace is an entire Covenant made by God, both for himſelf and for us. O Sirs! in the Covenant of grace God ſtands engaged to give whatſoever he requires.</p>

               <p>O Sirs! when all is cloudy over head, and all dark with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doors, when a Chriſtians graces are not tranſparent, when his evidences for heaven are ſoiled and blotted, and when neither heart nor houſe are as they ſhould be, 'tis good then to turn to the Covenant grace, and to dwell upon the Covenant of grace. Thus <hi>David</hi> did, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though my houſe be not ſo with God, yet he hath made with me an everlaſting covenant, ordered in all things and ſure: for this is all my ſalvation, and all my deſire, although he make it not to grow.</hi> Let me give a little light into the words.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ordered in all things.]</hi> O! what head can conceive, or what tongue can expreſs that infinite counſel, wiſdom, love, care and tenderneſs that the bleſſed God has expreſt in order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Covenant of grace, ſo as it may moſt and beſt ſuit to all the wants, and ſtraits, and neceſſities, and miſeries, and deſires, and longings of poor ſinners ſouls.

Now, the purpoſe of God's election is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a foundation, becauſe it is that upon which all our happineſs and bleſſedneſs is built and bottomed, and becauſe as a foundation it abides firm and ſure. And as the Covenant of grace is bottomed upon the free purpoſe of God, ſo 'tis bottomed upon the glorious power of God. The power of God is an infinite power,<note place="margin">Iſa. 33.11. Iſa. 41.2. Mal. 4.1. 1 Cor. 1.25.</note> it is a ſupream power, a power that overtops the power of all mortals: What's the ſtubble to the flames, the chaff to the whirlwind? no more is all created power to the power of God.

In all the ages of the world the power of God hath bore down all before it; the power of God is an independant power, a matchleſs power, an incomparable power, an enduring power, an eternal power. And as the Covenant of grace is bottomed upon the power of God,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.17, 18 Pſal. 89.34, 35.</note> ſo it is bottomed upon the oath of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.72. <hi>To perform the mercy promiſed to our fathers, and to remember his holy Covenant.</hi> Ver. 73. <hi>The oath which he ſware to our father</hi> Abraham.

               <p>
                  <hi>For this is all my ſalvation and all my deſire.]</hi> i. e. This is the great ground of all my hope concerning my ſalvation, and of all the happineſs and bleſſedneſs which I look for in another world. This everlaſting Covenant, this ſure Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, is the great Charter of Charters that I have to ſhew for eternal bliſs. <hi>David</hi> was drawing neer to his eternal home, and whether his graces and gracious evidences for heavens happineſs were bright and ſhining, or blotted and clouded, I ſhall not at this time ſtand to enquire; it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that he ſtayes his ſoul upon the Covenant of grace, and that he comforts and ſolaces his ſoul in the Covenant of grace. And, O that all Chriſtians, when their graces and gracious evidences are either clouded or blotted, or elſe ſparkling and ſhining, that they would frequently eye theſe three royal Forts, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The free-grace and favour of God. 2. The Mediatory righteouſneſs of Chriſt. 3. The Covenant of grace. Now, that I may the more effectually prevail with you to look upon theſe royal Forts, and to delight in theſe royal Forts, and to prize theſe royal Forts, and to improve
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:52491:211"/> theſe royal Forts. Give me leave to offer theſe three things briefly to your conſideration.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Our beſt graces and performances are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and ſquare payment in the eyes of pure juſtice; all of them as inherent in us, and acted by us, are but imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect excellencies. No man hath ſo much grace and holineſs as is required, nor doth he ſo much as he is obliged to do: Every particular grace, though it be of an heavenly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine original, yet it is like the Stars twinkling, though placed in the heavens; ſo that if God ſhould enter into judgment with the moſt righteous perſon, even the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs that is in him,<note place="margin">Pſal. 143.2. Job. 14.3, 4. Rom. 3.20.</note> would not be ſafety and defence unto him; for what a deal of pride have we mixt with a little hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility? and what a deal of paſſion have we mixt with a little meekneſs? and what a deal of hypocriſie have we mixt with a little ſincerity? and what a deal of earthly-mindedneſs have we mixt with a little heavenly-mindedneſs? and what a deal of unbelief have we mixt with a little faith? O Sirs! in the great buſineſs of your acceſs to God, and of your acceptance with God,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.20, to ver. 27. Phil. 3.8, 9, 10.</note> and of your reconciliation to God, and of your ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification before God. 'Tis beſt, ſafeſt and nobleſt, to bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom your faith, hope and expectation, infinitely rather upon imputed righteouſneſs than inherent righteouſneſs, upon what Chriſt has done for you, than upon what he has done in you. Inherent righteouſneſs is ſtained, imperfect, impure; but imputed righteouſneſs is pure and perfect; if there were any ſtain, or any imperfection in that, it could not juſtifie us, it could not ſave us, it could not ſecure us from wrath to come. Such evidences as are not fetcht from any thing in us, nor from any things done by us, but are fetcht by faith from our free juſtification, and from Chriſt's full ſatisfaction which he hath wrought for us, will be found the moſt full, the moſt ſweet, the moſt refreſhing, the moſt comforting, and the moſt ſatisfying evidences. Chriſt is all fair, all perfect, all pure, and therefore let him be moſt in your eye, and moſt upon your hearts; but here take heed, that you don't look upon your graces, or your gracious evidences, as poor, low, weak, contemptible things (as too many do) for the leaſt of
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:52491:211"/> them is more worth than heaven and earth, and they may yield you much comfort, much ſupport, much refreſhing, and much ſatisfaction; though they can't yield you that full comfort, nor that full ſatisfaction as Chriſt himſelf can yield, as Chriſt's ſatisfaction can yield, as free juſtification can yield. Though children and friends can't yield to a Wife that full comfort, content, delight and ſatisfaction as her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band does, yet they may yield her much comfort, much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, much delight, much ſatisfaction. The application is eaſie. But,</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider, That Chriſtian that hath free-grace, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that hath free juſtification, that hath the Mediatory righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt, that hath the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, that hath the Covenant of grace moſt conſtantly in his ſight, and moſt frequently warm upon his heart, that Chriſtian of all Chriſtians in the world is moſt free from a world of fears, and doubts, and ſcruples, which do ſad, ſink, perplex and preſs down a world of other Chriſtians, who affect a life of ſenſe, and who daily eye more what Chriſt is a doing in them, and what they are a doing for Chriſt, than they do eye, either his active or paſſive obedience. Chriſt hath done great things for his people, and he has ſuffered great things for his people, and he has purchaſed great things for his people, and he has prepared great things for his people; and yet many of his own dear people are ſo taken up with their own hearts, and with their own duties and graces, that Chriſt is little eyed by them, or minded by them; and what is this but to be more taken with the ſtreams than with the Fountain? with the leaves, bloſſoms and fruit, than with the Tree it ſelf? with the bracelets, ear-rings and gold chains, than with the Husband himſelf? with the Nobles that wait, than with the King that is waited on? And this is the great Reaſon why ſo many Chriſtians (who will certainly go to heaven) do walk in darkneſs, and lye down in ſorrow. But,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Truſting in our own duties, and reſting on our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> own righteouſneſs (and not on Chriſt's ſolely) is a cloſe, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:52491:212"/> ſpiritual,<note place="margin">Iſa. 58.1, 2, 3. Zech. 7.5, 6.</note> dangerous and unperceivable ſin, which the nature of man is exceedingly prone unto. The Phariſees were mightily given up to truſt in their own righteouſneſs, to reſt on their own righteouſneſs,<note place="margin">Mat. 6. chap. 23 Luke 18.</note> and to boaſt and glory in their own righteouſneſs; and this prov'd their mortal diſeaſe, their damning ſin: truſting in their own righteouſneſs had ſo beſotted and benummed them, that they had no mind, no heart to open the gates of their ſouls, that the King of glory might enter in. And this was that which undid the <hi>Jews, Rom.</hi> 10.3. <hi>For they being ignorant of Gods righteouſneſs, and going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, have not ſubmitted themſelves to the righteouſneſs of God.</hi> And 'tis obſervable, the Apoſtle uſeth an emphatical word of a <hi>Jew, Rom.</hi> 2.17. Thou reſteſt in the Law,<note place="margin">Look as there is nothing more pleaſing to Chriſt, than the renouncing of all confidence in our own duties and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; ſo there is nothing more provoking to Chriſt, than the ſetting up of our own du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. This is a ſecret Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſthume that kills thouſands.</note>

                  </gap>, thou art ſecure in the Law, as in ſome admirable priviledge and ſignal teſtimony of Gods love. This was <hi>Bernards</hi> temptation, when being aſſiſted in duty he could ſtroak his own head with <hi>bene feciſti Bernarde;</hi> O <hi>Bernard,</hi> this was gallantly done, now chear up thy ſelf. It was the ſaying of a precious Saint, That he was more afraid of his duties than of his ſins, for the one made him often proud, and the other made him alwayes humble. It was good counſel <hi>Luther</hi> gave, <hi>Cavendum eſt non ſolum à peccatis, ſed à bonis operibus;</hi> We muſt take heed not only of our ſins, but of our good works. Duties can never have too much diligence uſed about them, nor too little confidence placed in them; they are good helps, but bad Saviours; it is neceſſary we do them, but it is dangerous to rely upon them. If the devil cannot diſſwade us from performing Religious duties, then his next work will be to perſwade us all he can to rely upon them to make Saviours of them, becauſe this will as much gratifie Satan, and as certainly ruin our ſouls, as if we had wholly neglected them. O man, thine own righteouſneſs reſted in, will as certainly and eternally undo thee as the greateſt and fouleſt enormities. This ſoul-ſickneſs is that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Idolatry that will undo thee, for thou makeſt thy ſelf a Saviour, and thy duties a Saviour, and ſayeſt of thy duties, as they did of the golden Calf; <hi>Theſe are the gods that brought thee out of the Land of Egypt.</hi> Open wickedneſs, open idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:52491:212"/> ſlayes her thouſands, but ſecret idolatry, a ſecret reſting upon duties ſlayes her ten thouſands; multitudes bleed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by this diſeaſe, and die for ever. Open prophaneſs is the broad dirty way that leads to hell, but Religious duties reſted in, is as ſure a way, though a cleaner way to hell; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane perſons and formal Profeſſors, ſhall meet at laſt in one hell. Ah Chriſtians! don't make Religious duties your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, leſt you and your money periſh together. The Phenix gathers ſweet odoriferous ſticks in <hi>Arabia</hi> together, and then blows them with her wings and burns with them: So do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhining Profeſſors burn themſelves with their own duties and ſervices. You know in <hi>Noahs</hi> floud, all that were not in the Ark, though they climb up the talleſt Trees, and the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Mountains and Hills, yet were drowned: So let men climb up to the higheſt duties, yet if they be not houſed in Chriſt, &amp; in his righteouſneſs, they will be as certainly damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the men in the old world were certainly drowned. <hi>Adam</hi> and all his poſterity was to be ſaved by doing; <hi>Do this and live.</hi> And hence it is natural to all the ſons and daughters of <hi>Adam</hi> to reſt on duties, and to look for life and happineſs in a way of doing; but if ſalvation were to be had by doing, what need of a Saviour? Well, remember this once for all, ſuch as reſt on duties, ſuch as reſt on their own righteouſneſs, or on any thing on this ſide Chriſt, ſuch ſhall find them as weak as the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> or as <hi>Jareb,</hi> they cannot heal them, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not cure them of their wounds:<note place="margin">Hoſ. 5.13.</note> When <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſaw his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and <hi>Judah</hi> ſaw his wound, then went <hi>Ephraim</hi> to the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> and ſent to King <hi>Jareb,</hi> yet could they not heal him, nor cure him of his wound. Duties are to Satan as the Ark of God was to the Philiſtines; he trembles to ſee a ſoul di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in the uſe of them, and yet not daring to rely on them but on Chriſt; but when he can draw poor ſouls to confide in their duties, and to reſt on their duties, then he has his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, then he claps his hands for joy, then he cryes out, Ah, ah, ſo would I have it. There is no ſin that doth ſo formally and immediately oppoſe Chriſt, and reject Chriſt, and provoke Chriſt, as this of reſting upon ſelf-righteouſneſs; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore above all, pray againſt this, and watch againſt this, and
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:52491:213"/> weep over this. There is no man in his wits that hath a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious lading, that will dare to adventure it in a crackt and broken veſſel; ſo there is no Chriſtian in his wits that will dare to adventure the everlaſting ſafety of his ſoul upon the leaking veſſels and bottoms of his own holineſs or ſervices. O Sirs! your duties cannot ſatisfie the Juſtice of God, they cannot ſatisfie the Law of God; your preſent duties cannot ſatisfie for your former ſins and rents that be behind. A man that payes his Rent honeſtly every year, does not thereby ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for the old Rent not paid in ten or twenty years before. Thy new obedience, O Chriſtian, is too weak to ſatisfie for old debts, and therefore roll thy ſelf on Chriſt, and Chriſt alone for life and for ſalvation. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> could ſay after all his diſputes for relying on works, on Saints and Angels, <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius eſt,</hi> &amp;c.

The Spirit is the root of all holineſs, and therefore the ſeveral parts of holineſs are called the fruits of the Spirit. Holineſs is the very picture of God;<note place="margin">Gal. 5.22.</note> and certainly no hand can carve that excellent pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but the Spirit of God. Holineſs is the Divine nature, and none can impart that to man but the Spirit; the Spirit is the great principle of holineſs. Now, the more grace, the more holineſs any man hath, the more he is the delight of the Spirit; and the more the Spirit will delight to witneſs his Sonſhip, his Saintſhip, and his Heirſhip unto him. Scripture and experience will tell you, that commonly men of greateſt holineſs have been men of greateſt aſſurance. This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, the more holineſs the more aſſurance; for ſo the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſes runs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.17. <hi>The work of righteouſneſs ſhall be peace</hi> (to wit, peace of conſcience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.) <hi>and the effect of righteouſneſs quietneſs and aſſurance for ever.</hi> Inherent righteouſneſs (for of that he ſpeaks, as is evident by the 15. and 16. verſes of the ſame Chapter) is the high-way to aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and peace.

There is a bleſſed aſſurance (as I have told you before) which ariſes from the diſcovery of grace in the ſoul. Now, the more ample, large and full the matter of our aſſurance is, the more ample, large and full muſt our aſſurance be.

When your graces are ſtrongeſt, and your evidences for heaven are cleareſt, and your comforts riſe higheſt upon the ſight of your graces or gracious evidences, then in a ſpecial manner it concerns you to make it your great buſineſs and work to act faith a freſh, to act faith with a greater ſtrength, upon the free, rich and glorious grace of God, and upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. 'Tis reported of the Chryſtal, that it hath ſuch a vertue in it, that the very touching of it quickens other ſtones, and
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:52491:215"/> puts a luſter and beauty upon them. This is moſt true of faith; faith is a grace that gives ſtrength and efficacy to all other graces, it is like a ſilver thred that runs thorow a chain of pearl, it hath an influence upon all other graces that are in the ſoul; faith is as the ſpring in the watch that moves the wheels, not a grace ſtirs till faith ſets it at work. What is ſaid of <hi>Solomons</hi> vertuous woman, <hi>viz.</hi>

We love as we believe, and we obey as we believe, and we hope as we believe, and we joy as we believe, and we mourn as we believe, and we repent as we believe; all graces keep time and pace with faith, &amp;c. Now when your graces are moſt ſhining, and your eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for heaven are moſt ſparkling, O then, give faith elbow-room, give faith full ſcope to exerciſe it ſelf upon the Lord Jeſus. <hi>Adams</hi> obedience to innocency was not more pleaſing and delightful to God, than the exerciſe of your faith on the Lord Jeſus will be at ſuch a time pleaſing and delightful to him; you are to look upon all your graces and gracious evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences as your higheſt encouragement to a lively, cheerful,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.13.

                  </note> Chriſt and his Mediatory righteouſneſs ſhould be more in a Chriſtians eye, and always lye nearer to a Chriſtians heart, than inherent righteouſneſs. Grace is a ring of gold, and Chriſt is the ſparkling diamond in that ring. Now, what's the ring to the ſparkling diamond? 'Tis not ſafe to pore more upon inherent righteouſneſs than upon imputed righteouſneſs. 'Tis not wiſdom to have our thoughts and hearts more taken up with our gracious diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and gracious actings, than with the perſon of Chriſt,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:52491:216"/> the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, the life of Chriſt, the death of Chriſt, the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, &amp;c. Dear Chriſtians, was it Chriſt, or was it your graces, or your gracious evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, or your gracious diſpoſitions, or your gracious act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that trod the wine-preſs of your Fathers wrath, that ſatisfied divine juſtice, that pacified divine anger, that did bear the curſe, that fulfill'd the Law, that brought in an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting righteouſneſs, that diſcharged your debts, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured you pardon, that made your peace, and that brought you into a ſtate of favour and friendſhip with God? If you anſwer (as you muſt) none but Chriſt, none but Chriſt; O then, let your thoughts and hearts be firſtly, moſtly, chiefly and laſtly taken up with the Lord Jeſus. Though inherent grace be a glorious creature, yet 'tis but a creature. Now, when your thoughts and hearts are more taken up with inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent grace, than they are with Chriſt the ſpring and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all grace; you make an idol of inherent grace,<note place="margin">John 1.16.

A Chriſtian may lawfully look upon his graces and his gracious evidences, and a Chriſtian ought to be much in bleſſing and praiſing of God for his graces and gracious evidences, and a Chriſtian may ſafely take comfort in his graces and gracious evidences as they are the fruits of God's eternal and unchangable love,<note place="margin">Iſa. 38.3. 2 Cor. 1.12.</note> but ſtill his work ſhould be to live upon Chriſt, and to lift up Chriſt above all. 'Tis Chriſt, 'tis his Mediatory righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, 'tis free-grace that a Chriſtian ought to make the chief and only ground and bottom of his hope and comforts. Though good old <hi>Jacob</hi> did really rejoyce in the chariots and wagons that <hi>Joſeph</hi> had ſent to bring him down to <hi>Egypt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 45.26, 27, 28.</note> yet he did more abundantly rejoyce in this, that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was alive, and that ſhortly he ſhould ſee and enjoy <hi>Joſeph</hi> himſelf. Though a Chriſtian may really rejoyce in his graces and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious evidences, yet above all he ought to rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, to triumph in Chriſt Jeſus,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.14. Phil. 3.3. 2 Cor. 2.14. Col. 3.11.</note> and to take up in Chriſt Jeſus as in his great all. There is a great aptneſs and proneſs in many (may I not ſay in moſt) gracious Chriſtians, to gaze ſo much and ſo long upon their graces, upon their gracious diſpoſitions, upon their gracious evidences, and upon their
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:52491:217"/> gracious actings, that too often they neglect the exerciſe of faith upon Chriſt, upon the promiſes; they gaze ſo much and ſo long upon what is wrought in them, and done by them, that they forget their grand work, which is immediate cloſing with Chriſt, immediate embracing of Chriſt, immediate relying upon Chriſt, immediate ſtaying, rowling, and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Chriſt, for juſtification and ſalvation. Now, from theſe frequent miſcarriages of Chriſtians, ſome have taken the liberty and boldneſs very hotly and peremptorily to cry down the total uſe of all characters, ſigns and marks, the evil of which I have formerly pointed at, and therefore let this touch ſuffice here. Grace is excellent, yea very excellent, but Chriſt is infinitely more excellent than all your graces, and therefore above all let Chriſt ſtill have the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence.<note place="margin">Col. 1.18.</note> Now, though it muſt be granted that a Chriſtian may lawfully make uſe of his graces and gracious evidences in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his ſupport, comfort and encouragement, yet it cannot be denyed but that the nobleſt, pureſt, higheſt and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent acts and exerciſes of faith,<note place="margin">Cant. 8.5.

O now, to turn to Chriſt, and to turn to the breaſts of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and to live upon Chriſt, and to hang upon a promiſe, is the way of wayes to exalt Chriſt, and to glorifie Chriſt; there is nothing that pleaſes Chriſt, or that delights Chriſt, or that is ſuch an honour to Chriſt, as theſe pure actings of faith are. Signs and evidences, are moſt ſweet, comfortable and pleaſing to us; but the pure actings of faith are moſt eyed and valued by Chriſt,<note place="margin">Cant. 3.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. &amp; 5.3, 4, 5, 6.</note> and therefore many times Chriſt draws a curtain between him and the ſoul, and cauſes a Chriſtians Sun to ſet at noon, and damps his joy, and marrs his peace, and clouds his evidences for heaven, on purpoſe to train up his children in the pure actings of faith. 'Tis ſad when Chriſtians make ſuch immoderate uſe of their ſigns, marks, evidences, as damps and hinders thoſe direct and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate acts of faith, whereby they ſhould receive Chriſt,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:52491:217"/> and apply Chriſt, and reſt upon Chriſt alone for pardon, peace, reconciliation, juſtification and ſalvation; he that pores ſo long and ſo much upon his graces or gracious evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences as ſhall hinder him from the freſh and frequent act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of faith upon Chriſt, he caſts contempt upon Chriſt.<note place="margin">Chriſt is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable cordial, he is worthily called the conſolation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Luke 2.25.</note> Though the ſight of a Chriſtians graces and gracious eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be very comfortable and delightful to him, yet the ſight of Chriſt ſhould be ten thouſand times more comfortable and delightful to him. O Sirs! what are the favourites to the King himſelf? What are the ſervants to the Lord they wait on? what are the friends of the Bridegroom to the Bridegroom himſelf? what are all the bracelets and jewels to the Husband that gives them? no more are all a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans graces or gracious evidences to the Lord Jeſus himſelf. A Chriſtian ſhould ſay to all his gifts, graces, evidences and ſervices, Stand by, make room for Chriſt, make room for Chriſt. Oh! none but Chriſt; Oh! none to Chriſt. Living by ſigns is moſt natural, pleaſing and comfortable to us, but living by faith is moſt honourable to Chriſt. It is ſaid, the juſt ſhall live by his faith, not by his evidences.<note place="margin">Hab. 2.4. Heb. 10.38.</note> When men pride themſelves in their evidences, and when men ſecretly lean upon their evidences inſtead of leaning upon Chriſt, and when men bottom their hopes and comforts upon their ſigns and evidences, when they ſhould be bottoming of all their hopes and comforts upon Chriſt; on a ſudden Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws, and the ſoul is immediately filled with clouds, fears, doubts, darkneſs; and all a mans graces and gracious evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences are eclipſed, and he can ſee nothing, nor feel nothing, but deadneſs, hardneſs, barrenneſs, hypocriſie, unbelief, ſelf-love, guilt, &amp;c. which makes him a <hi>Magor-Miſſabib,</hi> a terror to himſelf. Now the deſign of Chriſt in all this is to train up his people in a life of faith, and to teach them in the want of their ſigns and evidences,<note place="margin">Col. 3.3, 4. Col. 1.27.</note> how to live above their ſigns and evidences upon himſelf, who is their life, their hope, their heaven, their happineſs, their all. Now Chriſtians, the beſt way to prevent theſe ſore ſoul-diſtreſſes, is in the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate uſe of your ſigns and evidences, to live much in the freſh and frequent actings of faith upon the Lord Jeſus, and in ſo
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:52491:218"/> doing, you will neither grieve Chriſt, nor provoke Chriſt nor wrong your own precious and immortal ſouls. But,</p>
